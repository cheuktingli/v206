title: Heavy Sets with Applications to Interpretable Machine Learning Diagnostics
abstract: 'ML models take on a new life after deployment and raise a host of new challenges:
  data drift, model recalibration and monitoring. If performance erodes over time,
  engineers in charge may ask what changed â€“ did the data distribution change, did
  the model get worse after retraining? We propose a flexible paradigm for answering
  a variety of model diagnosis questions by finding heaviest-weight interpretable
  regions, which we call heavy sets. We associate a local weight describing model
  mismatch at each datapoint, and find a simple region maximizing the sum (or average)
  of these weights. Specific choices of weights can find regions where two models
  differ the most, where a single model makes unusually many errors, or where two
  datasets have large differences in densities. The premise is that a region with
  overall elevated errors (weights) may discover statistically significant effects
  despite individual errors not standing out in the noise. We focus on interpretable
  regions defined by sparse AND-rules (conjunctive rule using a small subset of available
  features). We first describe an exact integer programming (IP) formulation applicable
  to smaller data-sets. As the exact IP is NP-hard, we develop a greedy coordinate-wise
  dynamic-programming based formulation. For smaller datasets the heuristic often
  comes close in accuracy to the IP in objective, but it can scale to datasets with
  millions of examples and thousands of features. We also address statistical significance
  of the detected regions, taking care of multiple hypothesis testing and spatial
  dependence challenges that arise in model diagnostics. We evaluate our proposed
  approach both on synthetic data (with known ground-truth), and on well-known public
  ML datasets.'
