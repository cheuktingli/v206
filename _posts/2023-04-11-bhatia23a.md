title: 'Reward Learning as Doubly Nonparametric Bandits: Optimal Design and Scaling
  Laws'
abstract: Specifying reward functions for complex tasks like object manipulation or
  driving is challenging to do by hand. Reward learning seeks to address this by learning
  a reward model using human feedback on selected query policies. This shifts the
  burden of reward specification to the optimal design of the queries. We propose
  a theoretical framework for studying reward learning and the associated optimal
  experiment design problem. Our framework models rewards and policies as nonparametric
  functions belonging to subsets of Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces (RKHSs). The
  learner receives (noisy) oracle access to a true reward and must output a policy
  that performs well under the true reward. For this setting, we first derive non-asymptotic
  excess risk bounds for a simple plug-in estimator based on ridge regression. We
  then solve the query design problem by optimizing these risk bounds with respect
  to the choice of query set and obtain a finite sample statistical rate, which depends
  primarily on the eigenvalue spectrum of a certain linear operator on the RKHSs.
  Despite the generality of these results, our bounds are stronger than previous bounds
  developed for more specialized problems. We specifically show that the well-studied
  problem of Gaussian process (GP) bandit optimization is a special case of our framework,
  and that our bounds either improve or are competitive with known regret guarantees
  for the Mat√©rn kernel.
