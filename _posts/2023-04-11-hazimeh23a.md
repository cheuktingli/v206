title: 'Mind the (optimality) Gap: A Gap-Aware Learning Rate Scheduler for Adversarial
  Nets'
software: https://github.com/google-research/google-research/tree/master/adversarial_nets_lr_scheduler
abstract: 'Adversarial nets have proved to be powerful in various domains including
  generative modeling (GANs), transfer learning, and fairness. However, successfully
  training adversarial nets using first-order methods remains a major challenge. Typically,
  careful choices of the learning rates are needed to maintain the delicate balance
  between the competing networks. In this paper, we design a novel learning rate scheduler
  that dynamically adapts the learning rate of the adversary to maintain the right
  balance. The scheduler is driven by the fact that the loss of an ideal adversarial
  net is a constant known a priori. The scheduler is thus designed to keep the loss
  of the optimized adversarial net close to that of an ideal network. We run large-scale
  experiments to study the effectiveness of the scheduler on two popular applications:
  GANs for image generation and adversarial nets for domain adaptation. Our experiments
  indicate that adversarial nets trained with the scheduler are less likely to diverge
  and require significantly less tuning. For example, on CelebA, a GAN with the scheduler
  requires only one-tenth of the tuning budget needed without a scheduler. Moreover,
  the scheduler leads to statistically significant improvements in model quality,
  reaching up to 27$%$ in Frechet Inception Distance for image generation and 3$%$
  in test accuracy for domain adaptation.'
