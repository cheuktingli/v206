title: A Conditional Gradient-based Method for Simple Bilevel Optimization with Convex
  Lower-level Problem
software: https://github.com/Raymond30/CG-BiO
abstract: In this paper, we study a class of bilevel optimization problems, also known
  as simple bilevel optimization, where we minimize a smooth objective function over
  the optimal solution set of another convex constrained optimization problem. Several
  iterative methods have been developed for tackling this class of problems. Alas,
  their convergence guarantees are either asymptotic for the upper-level objective,
  or the convergence rates are slow and sub-optimal. To address this issue, in this
  paper, we introduce a novel bilevel optimization method that locally approximates
  the solution set of the lower-level problem via a cutting plane and then runs a
  conditional gradient update to decrease the upper-level objective. When the upper-level
  objective is convex, we show that our method requires ${O}(\max\{1/\epsilon_f,1/\epsilon_g\})$
  iterations to find a solution that is $\epsilon_f$-optimal for the upper-level objective
  and $\epsilon_g$-optimal for the lower-level objective. Moreover, when the upper-level
  objective is non-convex, our method requires ${O}(\max\{1/\epsilon_f^2,1/(\epsilon_f\epsilon_g)\})$
  iterations to find an $(\epsilon_f,\epsilon_g)$-optimal solution. We also prove
  stronger convergence guarantees under the Holderian error bound assumption on the
  lower-level problem. To the best of our knowledge, our method achieves the best-known
  iteration complexity for the considered class of bilevel problems.
