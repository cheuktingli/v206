title: On The Convergence Of Policy Iteration-Based Reinforcement Learning With Monte
  Carlo Policy Evaluation
abstract: A common technique in reinforcement learning is to evaluate the value function
  from Monte Carlo simulations of a given policy, and use the estimated value function
  to obtain a new policy which is greedy with respect to the estimated value function.
  A well-known longstanding open problem in this context is to prove the convergence
  of such a scheme when the value function of a policy is estimated from data collected
  from a single sample path obtained from implementing the policy (see page 99 of
  [Sutton and Barto, 2018], page 8 of [Tsitsiklis, 2002]). We present a solution to
  the open problem by showing that a first-visit version of such a policy iteration
  scheme indeed converges to the optimal policy provided that the policy improvement
  step uses lookahead [Silver et al., 2016, Mnih et al., 2016, Silver et al., 2017b]
  rather than a simple greedy policy improvement. We provide results both for the
  original open problem in the tabular setting and also present extensions to the
  function approximation setting, where we show that the policy resulting from the
  algorithm performs close to the optimal policy within a function approximation error.
