title: On double-descent in uncertainty quantification in overparametrized models
software: https://github.com/SPOC-group/double_descent_uncertainty
abstract: 'Uncertainty quantification is a central challenge in reliable and trustworthy
  machine learning. Naive measures such as last-layer scores are well-known to yield
  overconfident estimates in the context of overparametrized neural networks. Several
  methods, ranging from temperature scaling to different Bayesian treatments of neural
  networks, have been proposed to mitigate overconfidence, most often supported by
  the numerical observation that they yield better calibrated uncertainty measures.
  In this work, we provide a sharp comparison between popular uncertainty measures
  for binary classification in a mathematically tractable model for overparametrized
  neural networks: the random features model. We discuss a trade-off between classification
  accuracy and calibration, unveiling a double descent behavior in the calibration
  curve of optimally regularised estimators as a function of overparametrization.
  This is in contrast with the empirical Bayes method, which we show to be well calibrated
  in our setting despite the higher generalization error and overparametrization.'
