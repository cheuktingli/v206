title: Testing of Horn Samplers
software: https://github.com/uddaloksarkar/flash
abstract: 'Sampling over combinatorial spaces is a fundamental problem in artificial
  intelligence with a wide variety of applications. Since state-of-the-art techniques
  heavily rely on heuristics whose rigorous analysis remains beyond the reach of current
  theoretical tools, the past few years have witnessed interest in the design of techniques
  to test the quality of samplers. The current state-of-the-art techniques, $\mathsf{Barbarik}$
  and $\mathsf{Barbarik2}$, focuses on the cases where combinatorial spaces are encoded
  as Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF) formulas. While CNF is a general-purpose form,
  often techniques rely on exploiting specific representations to achieve speedup.
  Of particular interest are Horn clauses, which form the basis of the logic programming
  tools in AI. In this context, a natural question is whether it is possible to design
  a tester that can determine the correctness of a given Horn sampler. The primary
  contribution of this paper is an affirmative answer to the above question. We design
  the first tester, $\mathsf{Flash}$, which tests the correctness of a given Horn
  sampler: given a specific distribution $\mathcal{I}$ and parameters $\eta$, $\varepsilon$,
  and $\delta$, the tester $\mathsf{Flash}$ correctly (with probability at least $
  1-\delta$) distinguishes whether the underlying distribution of the Horn-sampler
  is “$\varepsilon$-close” to $\mathcal{I}$ or “$\eta$-far” from $\mathcal{I}$ by
  sampling only $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\mathsf{tilt}^3/(\eta - \varepsilon)^4)$
  samples from the Horn-sampler, where the $\mathsf{tilt}$ is the ratio of the maximum
  and the minimum (non-zero) probability masses of $\mathcal{I}$. We also provide
  a prototype implementation of $\mathsf{Flash}$ and test three state-of-the-art samplers
  on a set of benchmarks.'
