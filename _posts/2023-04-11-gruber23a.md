title: Uncertainty Estimates of Predictions via a General Bias-Variance Decomposition
software: https://github.com/MLO-lab/Uncertainty_Estimates_via_BVD
abstract: Reliably estimating the uncertainty of a prediction throughout the model
  lifecycle is crucial in many safety-critical applications. The most common way to
  measure this uncertainty is via the predicted confidence. While this tends to work
  well for in-domain samples, these estimates are unreliable under domain drift and
  restricted to classification. Alternatively, proper scores can be used for most
  predictive tasks but a bias-variance decomposition for model uncertainty does not
  exist in the current literature. In this work we introduce a general bias-variance
  decomposition for proper scores, giving rise to the Bregman Information as the variance
  term. We discover how exponential families and the classification log-likelihood
  are special cases and provide novel formulations. Surprisingly, we can express the
  classification case purely in the logit space. We showcase the practical relevance
  of this decomposition on several downstream tasks, including model ensembles and
  confidence regions. Further, we demonstrate how different approximations of the
  instance-level Bregman Information allow reliable out-of-distribution detection
  for all degrees of domain drift.
