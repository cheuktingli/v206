title: Faster Projection-Free Augmented Lagrangian Methods via Weak Proximal Oracle
abstract: This paper considers a convex composite optimization problem with affine
  constraints, which includes problems that take the form of minimizing a smooth convex
  objective function over the intersection of (simple) convex sets, or regularized
  with multiple (simple) functions. Motivated by high-dimensional applications in
  which exact projection/proximal computations are not tractable, we propose a projection-free
  augmented Lagrangian-based method, in which primal updates are carried out using
  a weak proximal oracle (WPO). In an earlier work, WPO was shown to be more powerful
  than the standard linear minimization oracle (LMO) that underlies conditional gradient-based
  methods (aka Frank-Wolfe methods). Moreover, WPO is computationally tractable for
  many high-dimensional problems of interest, including those motivated by recovery
  of low-rank matrices and tensors, and optimization over polytopes which admit efficient
  LMOs. The main result of this paper shows that under a certain curvature assumption
  (which is weaker than strong convexity), our WPO-based algorithm achieves an ergodic
  rate of convergence of $O(1/T)$ for both the objective residual and feasibility
  gap. This result, to the best of our knowledge, improves upon the $O(1/\sqrt{T})$
  rate for existing LMO-based projection-free methods for this class of problems.
  Empirical experiments on a low-rank and sparse covariance matrix estimation task
  and the Max Cut semidefinite relaxation demonstrate that of our method can outperform
  state-of-the-art LMO-based Lagrangian-based methods.
