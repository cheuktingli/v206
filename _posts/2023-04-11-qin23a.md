title: An Online and Unified Algorithm for Projection Matrix Vector Multiplication
  with Application to Empirical Risk Minimization
abstract: 'Online matrix vector multiplication is a fundamental step and bottleneck
  in many machine learning algorithms. It is defined as follows: given a matrix at
  the pre-processing phase, at each iteration one receives a query vector and needs
  to form the matrix-vector product (approximately) before observing the next vector.
  In this work, we study a particular instance of such problem called the online projection
  matrix vector multiplication. Via a reduction, we show it suffices to solve the
  inverse maintenance problem. Additionally, our framework supports dimensionality
  reduction to speed up the computation that approximates the matrix-vector product
  with an optimization-friendly error guarantee. Moreover, our unified approach can
  handle both data-oblivious sketching and data-dependent sampling. Finally, we demonstrate
  the effectiveness of our framework by speeding up the empirical risk minimization
  solver.'
