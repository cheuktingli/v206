title: Pricing against a Budget and ROI Constrained Buyer
software: nan
abstract: Internet advertisers (buyers) repeatedly procure ad impressions from ad
  platforms (sellers) with the aim to maximize total conversion (i.e. ad value) while
  respecting both budget and return-on-investment (ROI) constraints for efficient
  utilization of limited monetary resources. Facing such a constrained buyer who aims
  to learn her optimal strategy to acquire impressions, we study from a seller’s perspective
  how to learn and price ad impressions through repeated posted price mechanisms to
  maximize revenue. For this two-sided learning setup, we propose a learning algorithm
  for the seller that utilizes an episodic binary-search procedure to identify a revenue-optimal
  selling price. We show that such a simple learning algorithm enjoys low seller regret
  when within each episode, the budget and ROI constrained buyer approximately best
  responds to the posted price. We present simple yet natural buyer’s bidding algorithms
  under which the buyer approximately best responds while satisfying budget and ROI
  constraints, leading to a low regret for our proposed seller pricing algorithm.
  The design of our seller algorithm is motivated by the fact that the seller’s revenue
  function admits a bell-shaped structure when the buyer best responds to prices under
  budget and ROI constraints, enabling our seller algorithm to identify revenue-optimal
  selling prices efficiently.
