title: 'Contextual Linear Bandits under Noisy Features: Towards Bayesian Oracles'
software: https://github.com/junghunkim7786/contextual_linear_bandits_under_noisy_features
abstract: We study contextual linear bandit problems under feature uncertainty; they
  are noisy with missing entries. To address the challenges of the noise, we analyze
  Bayesian oracles given observed noisy features. Our Bayesian analysis finds that
  the optimal hypothesis can be far from the underlying realizability function, depending
  on the noise characteristics, which are highly non-intuitive and do not occur for
  classical noiseless setups. This implies that classical approaches cannot guarantee
  a non-trivial regret bound. Therefore, we propose an algorithm that aims at the
  Bayesian oracle from observed information under this model, achieving $\tilde{O}(d\sqrt{T})$
  regret bound when there is a large number of arms. We demonstrate the proposed algorithm
  using synthetic and real-world datasets.
