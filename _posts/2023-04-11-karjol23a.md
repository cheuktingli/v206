title: Neural Discovery of Permutation Subgroups
software: https://github.com/RohanVKashyap/G-invariant/tree/master/notebooks
abstract: We consider the problem of discovering subgroup $H$ of permutation group
  $S_n$. Unlike the traditional $H$-invariant networks wherein $H$ is assumed to be
  known, we present a method to discover the underlying subgroup, given that it satisfies
  certain conditions. Our results show that one could discover any subgroup of type
  $S_k (k \leq n)$ by learning an $S_n$-invariant function and a linear transformation.
  We also prove similar results for cyclic and dihedral subgroups. Finally, we provide
  a general theorem that can be extended to discover other subgroups of $S_n$. We
  also demonstrate the applicability of our results through numerical experiments
  on image-digit sum and symmetric polynomial regression tasks.
