title: Matching Map Recovery with an Unknown Number of Outliers
software: https://github.com/TigranGalstyan/Matching-Map-Recovery-with-Outliers
abstract: We consider the problem of finding the matching map between two sets of
  $d$-dimensional noisy feature-vectors. The distinctive feature of our setting is
  that we do not assume that all the vectors of the first set have their corresponding
  vector in the second set. If $n$ and $m$ are the sizes of these two sets, we assume
  that the matching map that should be recovered is defined on a subset of unknown
  cardinality $k^*\le \min(n,m)$. We show that, in the high-dimensional setting, if
  the signal-to-noise ratio is larger than $5(d\log(4nm/\alpha))^{1/4}$, then the
  true matching map can be recovered with probability $1-\alpha$. Interestingly, this
  threshold does not depend on $k^*$ and is the same as the one obtained in prior
  work in the case of $k = \min(n,m)$. The procedure for which the aforementioned
  property is proved is obtained by a data-driven selection among candidate mappings
  $\{\hat\pi_k:k\in[\min(n,m)]\}$. Each $\hat\pi_k$ minimizes the sum of squares of
  distances between two sets of size $k$. The resulting optimization problem can be
  formulated as a minimum-cost flow problem, and thus solved efficiently. Finally,
  we report the results of numerical experiments on both synthetic and real-world
  data that illustrate our theoretical results and provide further insight into the
  properties of the algorithms studied in this work.
