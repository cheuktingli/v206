title: A Blessing of Dimensionality in Membership Inference through Regularization
software: https://github.com/tanjasper/benign_overparam_MI
abstract: 'Is overparameterization a privacy liability? In this work, we study the
  effect that the number of parameters has on a classifier’s vulnerability to membership
  inference attacks. We first demonstrate how the number of parameters of a model
  can induce a privacy-utility trade-off: increasing the number of parameters generally
  improves generalization performance at the expense of lower privacy. However, remarkably,
  we then show that if coupled with proper regularization, increasing the number of
  parameters of a model can actually simultaneously increase both its privacy and
  performance, thereby eliminating the privacy-utility trade-off. Theoretically, we
  demonstrate this curious phenomenon for logistic regression with ridge regularization
  in a bi-level feature ensemble setting. Pursuant to our theoretical exploration,
  we develop a novel leave-one-out analysis tool to precisely characterize the vulnerability
  of a linear classifier to the optimal membership inference attack. We empirically
  exhibit this “blessing of dimensionality” for neural networks on a variety of tasks
  using early stopping as the regularizer'
