title: Meta-learning for Robust Anomaly Detection
abstract: We propose a meta-learning method to improve the anomaly detection performance
  on unseen target tasks that have only unlabeled data. Existing meta-learning methods
  for anomaly detection have shown remarkable performance but require labeled data
  in target tasks. Although they can treat unlabeled data as normal assuming anomalies
  in the unlabeled data are negligible, this assumption is often violated in practice.
  As a result, the methods have low performance. Our method meta-learns with related
  tasks that have labeled and unlabeled data such that the expected test anomaly detection
  performance is directly improved when the anomaly detector is adapted to given unlabeled
  data. Our method is based on autoencoders (AEs), which are widely used neural network-based
  anomaly detectors. We model anomalous attributes for each unlabeled instance in
  the reconstruction loss of the AE, which are used to prevent the anomalies from
  being reconstructed; they can remove the effect of the anomalies. We formulate adaptation
  to the unlabeled data as a learning problem of the last layer of the AE and the
  anomalous attributes. This formulation enables the optimum solution to be obtained
  with a closed-form alternate update formula, which is preferable to efficiently
  maximize the expected test anomaly detection performance. The effectiveness of our
  method is experimentally shown with four real-world datasets.
