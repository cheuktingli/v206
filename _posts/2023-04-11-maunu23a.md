title: Bures-Wasserstein Barycenters and Low-Rank Matrix Recovery
software: https://github.com/twmaunu/BWMR
abstract: We revisit the problem of recovering a low-rank positive semidefinite matrix
  from rank-one projections using tools from optimal transport. More specifically,
  we show that a variational formulation of this problem is equivalent to computing
  a Wasserstein barycenter. In turn, this new perspective enables the development
  of new geometric first-order methods with strong convergence guarantees in Bures-Wasserstein
  distance. Experiments on simulated data demonstrate the advantages of our new methodology
  over existing methods.
