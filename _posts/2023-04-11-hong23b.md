title: An Optimization-based Algorithm for Non-stationary Kernel Bandits without Prior
  Knowledge
software: https://github.com/kihyukh/aistats2023
abstract: We propose an algorithm for non-stationary kernel bandits that does not
  require prior knowledge of the degree of non-stationarity. The algorithm follows
  randomized strategies obtained by solving optimization problems that balance exploration
  and exploitation. It adapts to non-stationarity by restarting when a change in the
  reward function is detected. Our algorithm enjoys a tighter dynamic regret bound
  than previous work on non- stationary kernel bandits. Moreover, when applied to
  the non-stationary linear bandits by us- ing a linear kernel, our algorithm is nearly
  minimax optimal, solving an open problem in the non-stationary linear bandit literature.
  We extend our algorithm to use a neural network for dynamically adapting the feature
  mapping to observed data. We prove a dynamic regret bound of the extension using
  the neural tangent kernel theory. We demonstrate empirically that our algorithm
  and the extension can adapt to varying degrees of non-stationarity.
