title: Probabilistic Conformal Prediction Using Conditional Random Samples
software: https://github.com/Zhendong-Wang/Probabilistic-Conformal-Prediction
abstract: This paper proposes probabilistic conformal prediction (PCP), a predictive
  inference algorithm that estimates a target variable by a discontinuous predictive
  set. Given inputs, PCP constructs the predictive set based on random samples from
  an estimated generative model. It is efficient and compatible with conditional generative
  models with either explicit or implicit density functions. We show that PCP guarantees
  correct marginal coverage with finite samples and give empirical evidence of conditional
  coverage. We study PCP on a variety of simulated and real datasets. Compared to
  existing conformal prediction methods, PCP provides sharper predictive sets.
