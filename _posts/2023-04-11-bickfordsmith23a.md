title: Prediction-Oriented Bayesian Active Learning
software: https://github.com/fbickfordsmith/epig
abstract: Information-theoretic approaches to active learning have traditionally focused on
  maximising the information gathered about the model parameters, most commonly by
  optimising the BALD score. We highlight that this can be suboptimal from the perspective
  of predictive performance. For example, BALD lacks a notion of an input distribution and
  so is prone to prioritise data of limited relevance. To address this we propose the
  expected predictive information gain (EPIG), an acquisition function that measures
  information gain in the space of predictions rather than parameters. We find that using
  EPIG leads to stronger predictive performance compared with BALD across a range of
  datasets and models, and thus provides an appealing drop-in replacement.
