title: Estimating Conditional Average Treatment Effects with Missing Treatment Information
software: https://github.com/mkuzma96/MTRNet
abstract: 'Estimating conditional average treatment effects (CATE) is challenging,
  especially when treatment information is missing. Although this is a widespread
  problem in practice, CATE estimation with missing treatments has received little
  attention. In this paper, we analyze CATE estimation in the setting with missing
  treatments where unique challenges arise in the form of covariate shifts. We identify
  two covariate shifts in our setting: (i) a covariate shift between the treated and
  control population; and (ii) a covariate shift between the observed and missing
  treatment population. We first theoretically show the effect of these covariate
  shifts by deriving a generalization bound for estimating CATE in our setting with
  missing treatments. Then, motivated by our bound, we develop the missing treatment
  representation network (MTRNet), a novel CATE estimation algorithm that learns a
  balanced representation of covariates using domain adaptation. By using balanced
  representations, MTRNet provides more reliable CATE estimates in the covariate domains
  where the data are not fully observed. In various experiments with semi-synthetic
  and real-world data, we show that our algorithm improves over the state-of-the-art
  by a substantial margin.'
