title: An Homogeneous Unbalanced Regularized Optimal Transport Model with Applications
  to Optimal Transport with Boundary
software: https://github.com/tlacombe/homogeneousUROT/
abstract: This work studies how the introduction of the entropic regularization term
  in unbalanced Optimal Transport (OT) models may alter their homogeneity with respect
  to the input measures. We observe that in common settings (including balanced OT
  and unbalanced OT with Kullback-Leibler divergence to the marginals), although the
  optimal transport cost itself is not homogeneous, optimal transport plans and the
  so-called Sinkhorn divergences are indeed homogeneous. However, homogeneity does
  not hold in more general Unbalanced Regularized Optimal Transport (UROT) models,
  for instance those using the Total Variation as divergence to the marginals. We
  propose to modify the entropic regularization term to retrieve an UROT model that
  is homogeneous while preserving most properties of the standard UROT model. We showcase
  the importance of using our Homogeneous UROT (HUROT) model when it comes to regularize
  Optimal Transport with Boundary, a transportation model involving a spatially varying
  divergence to the marginals for which the standard (inhomogeneous) UROT model would
  yield inappropriate behavior.
