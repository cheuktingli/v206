title: The Lauritzen-Chen Likelihood For Graphical Models
software: No code provided with paper.
abstract: Graphical models such as Markov random fields (MRFs) that are associated
  with undirected graphs, and Bayesian networks (BNs) that are associated with directed
  acyclic graphs, have proven to be a very popular approach for reasoning under uncertainty,
  prediction problems and causal inference. Parametric MRF likelihoods are well-studied
  for Gaussian and categorical data. However, in more complicated parametric and semi-parametric
  settings, likelihoods specified via clique potential functions are generally not
  known to be congenial or non-redundant. Congenial and non-redundant DAG likelihoods
  are far simpler to specify in both parametric and semi-parametric settings by modeling
  Markov factors in the DAG factorization. However, DAG likelihoods specified in this
  way are not guaranteed to coincide in distinct DAGs within the same Markov equivalence
  class. This complicates likelihoods based model selection procedures for DAGs by
  “sneaking in” potentially unwarranted assumptions about edge orientations. In this
  paper we link a density function decomposition due to Chen with the clique factorization
  of MRFs described by Lauritzen to provide a general likelihood for MRF models. The
  proposed likelihood is composed of variationally independent, and non-redundant
  closed form functionals of the observed data distribution, and is sufficiently general
  to apply to arbitrary parametric and semi-parametric models. We use an extension
  of our developments to give a general likelihood for DAG models that is guaranteed
  to coincide for all members of a Markov equivalence class. Our results have direct
  applications for model selection and semi-parametric inference.
