title: Bayesian Strategy-Proof Facility Location via Robust Estimation
abstract: 'A seminal work by Moulin (1980) shows that the median voting scheme fully
  characterizes (deterministic) strategy-proof facility location mechanism for single-peaked
  preferences. In this simple setting, median also achieves the optimal social cost.
  In $d$ dimensions, strategy-proof mechanism is characterized by coordinate-wise
  median, which is known to have a large $\sqrt{d}$ approximation ratio of the social
  cost in the Euclidean space, whereas the socially optimal mechanism fails at being
  strategy-proof. In light of the negative results in the classic, worst-case setting,
  we initiate the study of Bayesian mechanism design for strategy-proof facility location
  for multi-dimensional Euclidean preferences, where the agentsâ€™ preferences are drawn
  from a distribution. We approach the problem via connections to algorithmic high-dimensional
  robust statistics. Specially, our contributions are the following: * We provide
  a general reduction from any robust estimation scheme to Bayesian approximately
  strategy-proof mechanism. This leads to new strategy-proof mechanisms for Gaussian
  and bounded moment distributions, by leveraging recent advances in robust statistics.
  * We show that the Lugosi-Mendelson median arising from heavy-tailed statistics
  can be used to obtain Bayesian approximately strategy-proof single-facility mechanism
  with asymptotically optimal social cost, under mild distributional assumptions.
  * We provide Bayesian approximately strategy-proof multi-facility mechanisms for
  Gaussian mixture distributions with nearly optimal social cost.'
