title: 'Fixing by Mixing: A Recipe for Optimal Byzantine ML under Heterogeneity'
abstract: Byzantine machine learning (ML) aims to ensure the resilience of distributed
  learning algorithms to misbehaving (or Byzantine) machines. Although this problem
  received significant attention, prior works often assume the data held by the machines
  to be homogeneous, which is seldom true in practical settings. Data heterogeneity
  makes Byzantine ML considerably more challenging, since a Byzantine machine can
  hardly be distinguished from a non-Byzantine outlier. A few solutions have been
  proposed to tackle this issue, but these provide suboptimal probabilistic guarantees
  and fare poorly in practice. This paper closes the theoretical gap, achieving optimality
  and inducing good empirical results. In fact, we show how to automatically adapt
  existing solutions for (homogeneous) Byzantine ML to the heterogeneous setting through
  a powerful mechanism, we call nearest neighbor mixing (NNM), which boosts any standard
  robust distributed gradient descent variant to yield optimal Byzantine resilience
  under heterogeneity. We obtain similar guarantees (in expectation) by plugging NNM
  in the distributed stochastic heavy ball method, a practical substitute to distributed
  gradient descent. We obtain empirical results that significantly outperform state-of-the-art
  Byzantine ML solutions.
