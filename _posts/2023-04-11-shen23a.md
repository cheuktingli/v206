title: PAC Learning of Halfspaces with Malicious Noise in Nearly Linear Time
abstract: We study the problem of efficient PAC learning of halfspaces in $\mathbb{R}^d$
  in the presence of the malicious noise, where a fraction of the training samples
  are adversarially corrupted. A series of recent works have developed polynomial-time
  algorithms that enjoy near-optimal sample complexity and noise tolerance, yet leaving
  open whether a linear-time algorithm exists and matches these appealing statistical
  performance guarantees. In this work, we give an affirmative answer by developing
  an algorithm that runs in time $\tilde{O}(m d )$, where $m = \tilde{O}(\frac{d}{\epsilon})$
  is the sample size and $\epsilon \in (0, 1)$ is the target error rate. Notably,
  the computational complexity of all prior algorithms suffer either a high order
  dependence on the problem size, or is implicitly proportional to $\frac{1}{\epsilon^2}$
  through the sample size. Our key idea is to combine localization and an approximate
  version of matrix multiplicative weights update method to progressively downweight
  the contribution of the corrupted samples while refining the learned halfspace.
