title: A New Modeling Framework for Continuous, Sequential Domains
software: https://github.com/LeonDong1993/Probabilistic_RNN/
abstract: 'Temporal models such as Dynamic Bayesian Networks (DBNs) and Hidden Markov
  Models (HMMs) have been widely used to model time-dependent sequential data. Typically,
  these approaches limit focus to discrete domains, employ first-order Markov and
  stationary assumptions, and limit representational power so that efficient (approximate)
  inference procedures can be applied. We propose a novel temporal model for continuous
  domains, where the transition distribution is conditionally tractable: it is modelled
  as a tractable continuous density over the variables at the current time slice only,
  while the parameters are controlled using a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) that
  takes all previous observations as input. We show that, in this model, various inference
  tasks can be efficiently implemented using forward filtering with simple gradient
  ascent. Our experimental results on two different tasks over several real-world
  sequential datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our model against existing
  competitors.'
