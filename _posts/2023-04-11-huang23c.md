title: 'Fix-A-Step: Semi-supervised Learning From Uncurated Unlabeled Data'
software: https://github.com/tufts-ml/fix-a-step
abstract: 'Semi-supervised learning (SSL) promises improved accuracy compared to training
  classifiers on small labeled datasets by also training on many unlabeled images.
  In real applications like medical imaging, unlabeled data will be collected for
  expediency and thus uncurated: possibly different from the labeled set in classes
  or features. Unfortunately, modern deep SSL often makes accuracy worse when given
  uncurated unlabeled data. Recent complex remedies try to detect out-of-distribution
  unlabeled images and then discard or downweight them. Instead, we introduce Fix-A-Step,
  a simpler procedure that views all uncurated unlabeled images as potentially helpful.
  Our first insight is that even uncurated images can yield useful augmentations of
  labeled data. Second, we modify gradient descent updates to prevent optimizing a
  multi-task SSL loss from hurting labeled-set accuracy. Fix-A-Step can “repair” many
  common deep SSL methods, improving accuracy on CIFAR benchmarks across all tested
  methods and levels of artificial class mismatch. On a new medical SSL benchmark
  called Heart2Heart, Fix-A-Step can learn from 353,500 truly uncurated ultrasound
  images to deliver gains that generalize across hospitals.'
