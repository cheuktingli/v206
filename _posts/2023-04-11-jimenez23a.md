title: Scalable Bayesian Optimization Using Vecchia Approximations of Gaussian Processes
software: https://github.com/feji3769/VecchiaBO
abstract: Bayesian optimization is a technique for optimizing black-box target functions.
  At the core of Bayesian optimization is a surrogate model that predicts the output
  of the target function at previously unseen inputs to facilitate the selection of
  promising input values. Gaussian processes (GPs) are commonly used as surrogate
  models but are known to scale poorly with the number of observations. Inducing point
  GP approximations can mitigate scaling issues, but may provide overly smooth estimates
  of the target function. In this work we adapt the Vecchia approximation, a popular
  GP approximation from spatial statistics, to enable scalable high-dimensional Bayesian
  optimization. We develop several improvements and extensions to Vecchia, including
  training warped GPs using mini-batch gradient descent, approximate neighbor search,
  and variance recalibration. We demonstrate the superior performance of Vecchia in
  BO using both Thompson sampling and qUCB. On several test functions and on two reinforcement-learning
  problems, our methods compared favorably to the state of the art, often outperforming
  inducing point methods and even exact GPs.
