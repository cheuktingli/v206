title: Multi-Agent congestion cost minimization with linear function approximations
software: https://github.com/PRA1TRIVEDI/MACCM
abstract: This work considers multiple agents traversing a network from a source node
  to the goal node. The cost to an agent for traveling a link has a private as well
  as a congestion component. The agentâ€™s objective is to find a path to the goal node
  with minimum overall cost in a decentralized way. We model this as a fully decentralized
  multi-agent reinforcement learning problem and propose a novel multi-agent congestion
  cost minimization (MACCM) algorithm. Our MACCM algorithm uses linear function approximations
  of transition probabilities and the global cost function. In the absence of a central
  controller and to preserve privacy, agents communicate the cost function parameters
  to their neighbors via a time-varying communication network. Moreover, each agent
  maintains its estimate of the global state-action value, which is updated via a
  multi-agent extended value iteration (MAEVI) sub-routine. We show that our MACCM
  algorithm achieves a sub-linear regret. The proof requires the convergence of cost
  function parameters, the MAEVI algorithm, and analysis of the regret bounds induced
  by the MAEVI triggering condition for each agent. We implement our algorithm on
  a two node network with multiple links to validate it. We first identify the optimal
  policy, the optimal number of agents going to the goal node in each period. We observe
  that the average regret is close to zero for 2 and 3 agents. The optimal policy
  captures the trade-off between the minimum cost of staying at a node and the congestion
  cost of going to the goal node. Our work is a generalization of learning the stochastic
  shortest path problem.
