title: On the Strategyproofness of the Geometric Median
software: https://github.com/sadeghfarhadkhani/GM_Startegyproof
abstract: 'The geometric median, an instrumental component of the secure machine learning
  toolbox, is known to be effective when robustly aggregating models (or gradients),
  gathered from potentially malicious (or strategic) users. What is less known is
  the extent to which the geometric median incentivizes dishonest behaviors. This
  paper addresses this fundamental question by quantifying its strategyproofness.
  While we observe that the geometric median is not even approximately strategyproof,
  we prove that it is asymptotically $\alpha$-strategyproof: when the number of users
  is large enough, a user that misbehaves can gain at most a multiplicative factor
  $\alpha$, which we compute as a function of the distribution followed by the users.
  We then generalize our results to the case where users actually care more about
  specific dimensions, determining how this impacts $\alpha$. We also show how the
  skewed geometric medians can be used to improve strategyproofness.'
