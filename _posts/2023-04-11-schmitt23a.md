title: Meta-Uncertainty in Bayesian Model Comparison
software: https://github.com/marvinschmitt/MetaUncertaintyPaper
abstract: Bayesian model comparison (BMC) offers a principled probabilistic approach
  to study and rank competing models. In standard BMC, we construct a discrete probability
  distribution over the set of possible models, conditional on the observed data of
  interest. These posterior model probabilities (PMPs) are measures of uncertainty,
  but—when derived from a finite number of observations—are also uncertain themselves.
  In this paper, we conceptualize distinct levels of uncertainty which arise in BMC.
  We explore a fully probabilistic framework for quantifying meta-uncertainty, resulting
  in an applied method to enhance any BMC workflow. Drawing on both Bayesian and frequentist
  techniques, we represent the uncertainty over the uncertain PMPs via meta-models
  which combine simulated and observed data into a predictive distribution for PMPs
  on new data. We demonstrate the utility of the proposed method in the context of
  conjugate Bayesian regression, likelihood-based inference with Markov chain Monte
  Carlo, and simulation-based inference with neural networks.
