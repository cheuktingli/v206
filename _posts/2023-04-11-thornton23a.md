title: Rethinking Initialization of the Sinkhorn Algorithm
software: https://github.com/ott-jax/ott
abstract: 'While the optimal transport (OT) problem was originally formulated as a
  linear program, the addition of entropic regularization has proven beneficial both
  computationally and statistically, for many applications. The Sinkhorn fixed-point
  algorithm is the most popular approach to solve this regularized problem, and, as
  a result, multiple attempts have been made to reduce its runtime using, e.g., annealing
  in the regularization parameter, momentum or acceleration. The premise of this work
  is that initialization of the Sinkhorn algorithm has received comparatively little
  attention, possibly due to two preconceptions: since the regularized OT problem
  is convex, it may not be worth crafting a good initialization, since any is guaranteed
  to work; secondly, because the outputs of the Sinkhorn algorithm are often unrolled
  in end-to-end pipelines, a data-dependent initialization would bias Jacobian computations.
  We challenge this conventional wisdom, and show that data-dependent initializers
  result in dramatic speed-ups, with no effect on differentiability as long as implicit
  differentiation is used. Our initializations rely on closed-forms for exact or approximate
  OT solutions that are known in the 1D, Gaussian or GMM settings. They can be used
  with minimal tuning, and result in consistent speed-ups for a wide variety of OT
  problems.'
