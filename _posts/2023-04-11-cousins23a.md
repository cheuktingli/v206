title: Revisiting Fair-PAC Learning and the Axioms of Cardinal Welfare
software: https://github.com/aistats2023/1095
abstract: Cardinal objectives serve as intuitive targets in fair machine learning
  by summarizing utility (welfare) or disutility (malfare) $u$ over $g$ groups. Under
  standard axioms, all welfare and malfare functions are $w$-weighted $p$-power-means,
  i.e. $M_p(u;w) = \sqrt[p]{\sum_{i=1}^g w_i u_i^p}$, with $p \leq 1$ for welfare,
  or $p \geq 1$ for malfare. We show the same under weaker axioms, and also identify
  stronger axioms that naturally restrict $p$. It is known that power-mean malfare
  functions are Lipschitz continuous, and thus statistically easy to estimate or learn.
  We show that all power means are locally Holder continuous, i.e., $|M(u; w)-M(u’
  ; w)| \leq \lambda \parallel u - u’\parallel^\alpha$ for some $\lambda$, $\alpha$,$\parallel
  \cdot \parallel$. In particular, $\lambda$ and $1/\alpha$ are bounded except as
  $p \rightarrow 0$ or $\min_i w_i \rightarrow 0$, and via this analysis we bound
  the sample complexity of optimizing welfare. This yields a novel concept of fair-PAC
  learning, wherein welfare functions are only polynomially harder to optimize than
  malfare functions, except when $p \approx 0$ or $\min_i w_i$ $\approx$ 0, which
  is exponentially harder.
