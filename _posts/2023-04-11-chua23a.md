title: Provable Hierarchy-Based Meta-Reinforcement Learning
abstract: Hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL) has seen widespread interest as
  an approach to tractable learning of complex modular behaviors. However, existing
  works either assume access to expert-constructed hierarchies, or use hierarchy-learning
  heuristics with no provable guarantees. To address this gap, we analyze HRL in the
  meta-RL setting, where a learner learns latent hierarchical structure during meta-training
  for use in a downstream task. We consider a tabular setting where natural hierarchical
  structure is embedded in the transition dynamics. Analogous to supervised meta-learning
  theory, we provide diversity conditions which, together with a tractable optimism-based
  algorithm, guarantee sample-efficient recovery of this natural hierarchy. Furthermore,
  we provide regret bounds on a learner using the recovered hierarchy to solve a meta-test
  task. Our bounds incorporate common notions in HRL literature such as temporal and
  state/action abstractions, suggesting that our setting and analysis capture important
  features of HRL in practice.
