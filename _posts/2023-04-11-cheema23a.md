title: 'Precision Recall Cover: A Method For Assessing Generative Models'
software: https://github.com/FasilCheema/GenerativeMetrics
abstract: Generative modelling has seen enormous practical advances over the past
  few years. Evaluating the quality of a generative system however is often still
  based on subjective human inspection. To overcome this, very recently the research
  community has turned to exploring formal evaluation metrics and methods. In this
  work, we propose a novel evaluation paradigm based on a two way nearest neighbor
  neighborhood test. We define a novel measure of mutual coverage for two continuous
  probability distributions. From this, we derive an empirical analogue and show analytically
  that it exhibits favorable theoretical properties while it is also straightforward
  to compute. We show that, while algorithmically simple, our derived method is also
  statistically sound. In contrast to previously employed distance measures, our measure
  naturally stems from a notion of local discrepancy, which can be accessed separately.
  This provides more detailed information to practitioners on the diagnosis of where
  their generative models will perform well, or conversely where their models fail.
  We complement our analysis with a systematic experimental evaluation and comparison
  to other recently proposed measures. Using a wide array of experiments we demonstrate
  our algorithms strengths over other existing methods and confirm our results from
  the theoretical analysis.
