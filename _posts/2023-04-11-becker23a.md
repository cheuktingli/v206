title: High Probability Bounds for Stochastic Continuous Submodular Maximization
abstract: We consider maximization of stochastic monotone continuous submodular functions
  (CSF) with a diminishing return property. Existing algorithms only guarantee the
  performance in expectation, and do not bound the probability of getting a bad solution.
  This implies that for a particular run of the algorithms, the solution may be much
  worse than the provided guarantee in expectation. In this paper, we first empirically
  verify that this is indeed the case. Then, we provide the first high-probability
  analysis of the existing methods for stochastic CSF maximization, namely PGA, boosted
  PGA, SCG, and SCG++. Finally, we provide an improved high-probability bound for
  SCG, under slightly stronger assumptions, with a better convergence rate than that
  of the expected solution. Through extensive experiments on non-concave quadratic
  programming (NQP) and optimal budget allocation, we confirm the validity of our
  bounds and show that even in the worst-case, PGA converges to $OPT/2$, and boosted
  PGA, SCG, SCG++ converge to $(1 - 1/e)OPT$, but at a slower rate than that of the
  expected solution.
