title: Provably Efficient Model-Free Algorithms for Non-stationary CMDPs
abstract: We study model-free reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms in episodic non-stationary
  constrained Markov decision processes (CMDPs), in which an agent aims to maximize
  the expected cumulative reward subject to a cumulative constraint on the expected
  utility (cost). In the non-stationary environment, the reward, utility functions,
  and the transition kernels can vary arbitrarily over time as long as the cumulative
  variations do not exceed certain variation budgets. We propose the first model-free,
  simulator-free RL algorithms with sublinear regret and zero constraint violation
  for non-stationary CMDPs in both tabular and linear function approximation settings
  with provable performance guarantees. Our results on regret bound and constraint
  violation for the tabular case match the corresponding best results for stationary
  CMDPs when the total budget is known. Additionally, we present a general framework
  for addressing with the well-known challenges associated with analyzing non-stationary
  CMDPs, without requiring prior knowledge of the variation budget. We apply the approach
  for both tabular and linear approximation settings.
