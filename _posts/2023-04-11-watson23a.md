title: Adversarial Random Forests for Density Estimation and Generative Modeling
software: https://github.com/bips-hb/arf_paper
abstract: We propose methods for density estimation and data synthesis using a novel
  form of unsupervised random forests. Inspired by generative adversarial networks,
  we implement a recursive procedure in which trees gradually learn structural properties
  of the data through alternating rounds of generation and discrimination. The method
  is provably consistent under minimal assumptions. Unlike classic tree-based alternatives,
  our approach provides smooth (un)conditional densities and allows for fully synthetic
  data generation. We achieve comparable or superior performance to state-of-the-art
  probabilistic circuits and deep learning models on various tabular data benchmarks
  while executing about two orders of magnitude faster on average. An accompanying
  $R$ package, $arf$, is available on $CRAN$.
