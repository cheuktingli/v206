title: Safe Sequential Testing and Effect Estimation in Stratified Count Data
software: https://github.com/rosanneturner/safeSequentialTestingAISTATS2023
abstract: Sequential decision making significantly speeds up research and is more
  cost-effective compared to fixed-n methods. We present a method for sequential decision
  making for stratified count data that retains Type-I error guarantee or false discovery
  rate under optional stopping, using e-variables. We invert the method to construct
  stratified anytime-valid confidence sequences, where cross-talk between subpopulations
  in the data can be allowed during data collection to improve power. Finally, we
  combine information collected in separate subpopulations through pseudo-Bayesian
  averaging and switching to create effective estimates for the minimal, mean and
  maximal treatment effects in the subpopulations.
