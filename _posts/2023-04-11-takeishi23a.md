title: Deep Grey-Box Modeling With Adaptive Data-Driven Models Toward Trustworthy
  Estimation of Theory-Driven Models
software: https://github.com/n-takeishi/deepgreybox
abstract: The combination of deep neural nets and theory-driven models (deep grey-box
  models) can be advantageous due to the inherent robustness and interpretability
  of the theory-driven part. Deep grey-box models are usually learned with a regularized
  risk minimization to prevent a theory-driven part from being overwritten and ignored
  by a deep neural net. However, an estimation of the theory-driven part obtained
  by uncritically optimizing a regularizer can hardly be trustworthy if we are not
  sure which regularizer is suitable for the given data, which may affect the interpretability.
  Toward a trustworthy estimation of the theory-driven part, we should analyze the
  behavior of regularizers to compare different candidates and to justify a specific
  choice. In this paper, we present a framework that allows us to empirically analyze
  the behavior of a regularizer with a slight change in the architecture of the neural
  net and the training objective.
