title: Nash Equilibria and Pitfalls of Adversarial Training in Adversarial Robustness
  Games
software: https://github.com/rattaoup/SLAR-game
abstract: Adversarial training is a standard technique for training adversarially
  robust models. In this paper, we study adversarial training as an alternating best-response
  strategy in a 2-player zero-sum game. We prove that even in a simple scenario of
  a linear classifier and a statistical model that abstracts robust vs. non-robust
  features, the alternating best response strategy of such game may not converge.
  On the other hand, a unique pure Nash equilibrium of the game exists and is provably
  robust. We support our theoretical results with experiments, showing the non-convergence
  of adversarial training and the robustness of Nash equilibrium.
