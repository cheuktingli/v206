title: Multilevel Bayesian Quadrature
software: https://github.com/CeciliaKaiyu/MLBQ
abstract: Multilevel Monte Carlo is a key tool for approximating integrals involving
  expensive scientific models. The idea is to use approximations of the integrand
  to construct an estimator with improved accuracy over classical Monte Carlo. We
  propose to further enhance multilevel Monte Carlo through Bayesian surrogate models
  of the integrand, focusing on Gaussian process models and the associated Bayesian
  quadrature estimators. We show, using both theory and numerical experiments, that
  our approach can lead to significant improvements in accuracy when the integrand
  is expensive and smooth, and when the dimensionality is small or moderate. We conclude
  the paper with a case study illustrating the potential impact of our method in landslide-generated
  tsunami modelling, where the cost of each integrand evaluation is typically too
  large for operational settings.
