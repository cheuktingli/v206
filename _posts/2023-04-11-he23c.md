title: 'SoundSynp: Sound Source Detection from Raw Waveforms with Multi-Scale Synperiodic
  Filterbanks'
software: https://github.com/yuhanghe01/SoundSynp
abstract: We propose synperiodic filter banks, a novel multi-scale learnable filter
  bank construction strategy that all filters are synchronized by their rotating periodicity.
  By synchronizing in a certain periodicity, we naturally get filters whose temporal
  length are reduced if they carry higher frequency response, and vice versa. Such
  filters internally maintain a better time-frequency resolution trade-off. By further
  alternating the periodicity, we can easily obtain a group of synperiodic filter
  bank (we call synperiodic filter banks), where filters of same frequency response
  in different groups differ in temporal length. Convolving these filter banks with
  sound raw waveform achieves multi-scale perception in time domain. Moreover, applying
  the same filter banks to recursively process the 2x-downsampled waveform enables
  multi-scale perception in the frequency domain. Benefiting from the multi-scale
  perception in both time and frequency domains, our proposed synperiodic filter banks
  learn multi-scale time-frequency representation in a data-driven way. Experiments
  on both sound source direction of arrival (DoA) and physical location detection
  task show the superiority of synperiodic filter banks.
