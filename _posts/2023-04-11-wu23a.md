title: Does Label Differential Privacy Prevent Label Inference Attacks?
software: https://github.com/jinpz/label_differential_privacy/
abstract: 'Label differential privacy (label-DP) is a popular framework for training
  private ML models on datasets with public features and sensitive private labels.
  Despite its rigorous privacy guarantee, it has been observed that in practice label-DP
  does not preclude label inference attacks (LIAs): Models trained with label-DP can
  be evaluated on the public training features to recover, with high accuracy, the
  very private labels that it was designed to protect. In this work, we argue that
  this phenomenon is not paradoxical and that label-DP is designed to limit the advantage
  of an LIA adversary compared to predicting training labels using the Bayes classifier.
  At label-DP $\epsilon=0$ this advantage is zero, hence the optimal attack is to
  predict according to the Bayes classifier and is independent of the training labels.
  Our bound shows the semantic protection conferred by label-DP and gives guidelines
  on how to choose $\epsilon$ to limit the threat of LIAs below a certain level. Finally,
  we empirically demonstrate that our result closely captures the behavior of simulated
  attacks on both synthetic and real world datasets.'
