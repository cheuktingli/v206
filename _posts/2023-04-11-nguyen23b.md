title: Feasible Recourse Plan via Diverse Interpolation
abstract: 'Explaining algorithmic decisions and recommending actionable feedback is
  increasingly important for machine learning applications. Recently, significant
  efforts have been invested in finding a diverse set of recourses to cover the wide
  spectrum of usersâ€™ preferences. However, existing works often neglect the requirement
  that the recourses should be close to the data manifold; hence, the constructed
  recourses might be implausible and unsatisfying to users. To address these issues,
  we propose a novel approach that explicitly directs the diverse set of actionable
  recourses towards the data manifold. We first find a diverse set of prototypes in
  the favorable class that balances the trade-off between diversity and proximity.
  We demonstrate two specific methods to find these prototypes: either by finding
  the maximum a posteriori estimate of a determinantal point process or by solving
  a quadratic binary program. To ensure the actionability constraints, we construct
  an actionability graph in which the nodes represent the training samples and the
  edges indicate the feasible action between two instances. We then find a feasible
  path to each prototype, and this path demonstrates the feasible actions for each
  recourse in the plan. The experimental results show that our method produces a set
  of recourses that are close to the data manifold while delivering a better cost-diversity
  trade-off than existing approaches.'
