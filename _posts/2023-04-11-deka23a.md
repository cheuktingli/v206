title: 'MMD-B-Fair: Learning Fair Representations with Statistical Testing'
software: https://github.com/namratadeka/mmd-b-fair
abstract: We introduce a method, MMD-B-Fair, to learn fair representations of data
  via kernel two-sample testing. We find neural features of our data where a maximum
  mean discrepancy (MMD) test cannot distinguish between different values of sensitive
  attributes, while preserving information about the target. Minimizing the power
  of an MMD test is more difficult than maximizing it (as done in previous work),
  because the test thresholdâ€™s complex behavior cannot be simply ignored. Our method
  exploits the simple asymptotics of block testing schemes to efficiently find fair
  representations without requiring the complex adversarial optimization or generative
  modelling schemes widely used by existing work on fair representation learning.
  We evaluate our approach on various datasets, showing its ability to hide information
  about sensitive attributes, and its effectiveness in downstream transfer tasks.
