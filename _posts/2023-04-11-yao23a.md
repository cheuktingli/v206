title: Error Estimation for Random Fourier Features
software: https://github.com/jwyyy/bootstrappedRFF
abstract: 'Random Fourier Features (RFF) is among the most popular and broadly applicable
  approaches for scaling up kernel methods. In essence, RFF allows the user to avoid
  costly computations with a large kernel matrix via a fast randomized approximation.
  However, a pervasive difficulty in applying RFF is that the user does not know the
  actual error of the approximation, or how this error will propagate into downstream
  learning tasks. Up to now, the RFF literature has primarily dealt with these uncertainties
  using theoretical error bounds, but from a user’s standpoint, such results are typically
  impractical—either because they are highly conservative or involve unknown quantities.
  To tackle these general issues in a data-driven way, this paper develops a bootstrap
  approach to numerically estimate the errors of RFF approximations. Three key advantages
  of this approach are: (1) The error estimates are specific to the problem at hand,
  avoiding the pessimism of worst-case bounds. (2) The approach is flexible with respect
  to different uses of RFF, and can even estimate errors in downstream learning tasks.
  (3) The approach enables adaptive computation, in the sense that the user can quickly
  inspect the error of a rough initial kernel approximation and then predict how much
  extra work is needed. Furthermore, in exchange for all of these benefits, the error
  estimates can be obtained at a modest computational cost.'
