title: Adversarial De-confounding in Individualised Treatment Effects Estimation
software: https://codeocean.com/capsule/1529546
abstract: Observational studies have recently received significant attention from
  the machine learning community due to the increasingly available non-experimental
  observational data and the limitations of the experimental studies, such as considerable
  cost, impracticality, small and less representative sample sizes, etc. In observational
  studies, de-confounding is a fundamental problem of individualised treatment effects
  (ITE) estimation. This paper proposes disentangled representations with adversarial
  training to selectively balance the confounders in the binary treatment setting
  for the ITE estimation. The adversarial training of treatment policy selectively
  encourages treatment-agnostic balanced representations for the confounders and helps
  to estimate the ITE in the observational studies via counterfactual inference. Empirical
  results on synthetic and real-world datasets, with varying degrees of confounding,
  prove that our proposed approach improves the state-of-the-art methods in achieving
  lower error in the ITE estimation.
