title: The Ordered Matrix Dirichlet for State-Space Models
software: https://github.com/niklasstoehr/ordered-matrix-dirichlet
abstract: 'Many dynamical systems in the real world are naturally described by latent
  states with intrinsic ordering, such as “ally”, “neutral”, and “enemy” relationships
  in international relations. These latent states manifest through countries’ cooperative
  versus conflictual interactions over time. State-space models (SSMs) explicitly
  relate the dynamics of observed measurements to transitions in latent states. For
  discrete data, SSMs commonly do so through a state-to-action emission matrix and
  a state-to-state transition matrix. This paper introduces the Ordered Matrix Dirichlet
  (OMD) as a prior distribution over ordered stochastic matrices wherein the discrete
  distribution in the kth row is stochastically dominated by the (k+1)th, such that
  probability mass is shifted to the right when moving down rows. We illustrate the
  OMD prior within two SSMs: a hidden Markov model, and a novel dynamic Poisson Tucker
  decomposition model tailored to international relations data. We find that models
  built on the OMD recover interpretable ordered latent structure without forfeiting
  predictive performance. We suggest future applications to other domains where models
  with stochastic matrices are popular (e.g., topic modeling), and publish user-friendly
  code.'
