title: Posterior Tracking Algorithm for Classification Bandits
abstract: The classification bandit problem aims to determine whether a set of given
  $K$ arms contains at least $L$ good arms or not. Here, an arm is said to be good
  if its expected reward is no less than a specified threshold. To solve this problem,
  we introduce an asymptotically optimal algorithm, named P-tracking, based on posterior
  sampling. Unlike previous asymptotically optimal algorithms that require solving
  a linear programming problem with an exponentially large number of constraints,
  P-tracking solves an equivalent optimization problem that can be computed in time
  linear in $K$. Additionally, unlike existing algorithms, P-tracking does not require
  forced exploration steps. Empirical results show that P-tracking outperforms existing
  algorithms in sample efficiency.
