title: 'MARS: Masked Automatic Ranks Selection in Tensor Decompositions'
software: https://github.com/MaxBourdon/mars
abstract: Tensor decomposition methods have proven effective in various applications,
  including compression and acceleration of neural networks. At the same time, the
  problem of determining optimal decomposition ranks, which present the crucial parameter
  controlling the compressionaccuracy trade-off, is still acute. In this paper, we
  introduce MARS - a new efficient method for the automatic selection of ranks in
  general tensor decompositions. During training, the procedure learns binary masks
  over decomposition cores that “select” the optimal tensor structure. The learning
  is performed via relaxed maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation in a specific Bayesian
  model and can be naturally embedded into the standard neural network training routine.
  Diverse experiments demonstrate that MARS achieves better results compared to previous
  works in various tasks.
