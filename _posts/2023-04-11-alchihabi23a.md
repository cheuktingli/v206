title: Learning Robust Graph Neural Networks with Limited Supervision
abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) require a relatively large number of labeled
  nodes and a reliable/uncorrupted graph connectivity structure to obtain good performance
  on the semi-supervised node classification task. The performance of GNNs can degrade
  significantly as the number of labeled nodes decreases or the graph connectivity
  structure is corrupted by adversarial attacks or noise in data measurement/collection.
  Therefore, it is important to develop GNN models that are able to achieve good performance
  when there is limited supervision knowledgeâ€“a few labeled nodes and a noisy graph
  structure. In this paper, we propose a novel Dual GNN learning framework to address
  this challenging task. The proposed framework has two GNN based node prediction
  modules. The primary module uses the input graph structure to induce typical node
  embeddings and predictions with a regular GNN baseline, while the auxiliary module
  constructs a new graph structure through fine-grained spectral clustering and learns
  new node embeddings and predictions. By integrating the two modules in a dual GNN
  learning framework, we perform joint learning in an end-to-end fashion. This general
  framework can be applied on many GNN baseline models. The experimental results show
  that the proposed dual GNN framework can greatly outperform the GNN baseline methods
  and yield superior performance over many state-of-the-art methods when the labeled
  nodes are scarce and the graph connectivity structure is noisy.
