title: Vector Optimization with Stochastic Bandit Feedback
software: https://github.com/Bilkent-CYBORG/Vector-Optimization-AISTATS-2023.git
abstract: We introduce vector optimization problems with stochastic bandit feedback,
  in which preferences among designs are encoded by a polyhedral ordering cone $C$.
  Our setup generalizes the best arm identification problem to vector-valued rewards
  by extending the concept of Pareto set beyond multi-objective optimization. We characterize
  the sample complexity of ($\epsilon,\delta$)-PAC Pareto set identification by defining
  a new cone-dependent notion of complexity, called the ordering complexity. In particular,
  we provide gap-dependent and worst-case lower bounds on the sample complexity and
  show that, in the worst-case, the sample complexity scales with the square of ordering
  complexity. Furthermore, we investigate the sample complexity of the na{ı̈}ve elimination
  algorithm and prove that it nearly matches the worst-case sample complexity. Finally,
  we run experiments to verify our theoretical results and illustrate how $C$ and
  sampling budget affect the Pareto set, the returned ($\epsilon,\delta$)-PAC Pareto
  set, and the success of identification.
