title: Clustering High-dimensional Data with Ordered Weighted $\ell_1$ Regularization
software: https://github.com/sayanpaul123/OWL_K_Means/
abstract: Clustering complex high-dimensional data is particularly challenging as
  the signal-to-noise ratio in such data is significantly lower than their classical
  counterparts. This is mainly because most of the features describing a data point
  have little to no information about the natural grouping of the data. Filtering
  such features is, thus, critical in harnessing meaningful information from such
  large-scale data. Many recent methods have attempted to find feature importance
  in a centroid-based clustering setting. Though empirically successful in classical
  low-dimensional settings, most perform poorly, especially on microarray and single-cell
  RNA-seq data. This paper extends the merits of weighted center-based clustering
  through the Ordered Weighted $\ell_1$ (OWL) norm for better feature selection. Appealing
  to the elegant properties of block coordinate-descent and Frank-Wolf algorithms,
  we are not only able to maintain computational efficiency but also able to outperform
  the state-of-the-art in high-dimensional settings. The proposal also comes with
  finite sample theoretical guarantees, including a rate of $\mathcal{O}\left(\sqrt{k
  \log p/n}\right)$, under model-sparsity, bridging the gap between theory and practice
  of weighted clustering.
