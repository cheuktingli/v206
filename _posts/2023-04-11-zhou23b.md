title: Domain Adaptation under Missingness Shift
abstract: 'Rates of missing data often depend on record-keeping policies and thus
  may change across times and locations, even when the underlying features are comparatively
  stable. In this paper, we introduce the problem of Domain Adaptation under Missingness
  Shift (DAMS). Here, (labeled) source data and (unlabeled) target data would be exchangeable
  but for different missing data mechanisms. We show that if missing data indicators
  are available, DAMS reduces to covariate shift. Addressing cases where such indicators
  are absent, we establish the following theoretical results for underreporting completely
  at random: (i) covariate shift is violated (adaptation is required); (ii) the optimal
  linear source predictor can perform arbitrarily worse on the target domain than
  always predicting the mean; (iii) the optimal target predictor can be identified,
  even when the missingness rates themselves are not; and (iv) for linear models,
  a simple analytic adjustment yields consistent estimates of the optimal target parameters.
  In experiments on synthetic and semi-synthetic data, we demonstrate the promise
  of our methods when assumptions hold. Finally, we discuss a rich family of future
  extensions.'
