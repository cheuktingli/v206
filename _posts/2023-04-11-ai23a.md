title: Generative Oversampling for Imbalanced Data via Majority-Guided VAE
software: https://github.com/Aiqz/MGVAE
abstract: Learning with imbalanced data is a challenging problem in deep learning.
  Over-sampling is a widely used technique to re-balance the sampling distribution
  of training data. However, most existing over-sampling methods only use intra-class
  information of minority classes to augment the data but ignore the inter-class relationships
  with the majority ones, which is prone to overfitting, especially when the imbalance
  ratio is large. To address this issue, we propose a novel over-sampling model, called
  Majority-Guided VAE(MGVAE), which generates new minority samples under the guidance
  of a majority-based prior. In this way, the newly generated minority samples can
  inherit the diversity and richness of the majority ones, thus mitigating overfitting
  in downstream tasks. Furthermore, to prevent model collapse under limited data,
  we first pre-train MGVAE on sufficient majority samples and then fine-tune based
  on minority samples with Elastic Weight Consolidation(EWC) regularization. Experimental
  results on benchmark image datasets and real-world tabular data show that MGVAE
  achieves competitive improvements over other over-sampling methods in downstream
  classification tasks, demonstrating the effectiveness of our method.
