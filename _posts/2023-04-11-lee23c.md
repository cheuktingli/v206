title: Deep Joint Source-Channel Coding with Iterative Source Error Correction
software: https://github.com/changwoolee/isec-deep-jscc
abstract: In this paper, we propose an iterative source error correction (ISEC) decoding
  scheme for deep-learning-based joint source-channel coding (Deep JSCC). Given a
  noisy codeword received through the channel, we use a Deep JSCC encoder and decoder
  pair to update the codeword iteratively to find a (modified) maximum a-posteriori
  (MAP) solution. For efficient MAP decoding, we utilize a neural network-based denoiser
  to approximate the gradient of the log-prior density of the codeword space. Albeit
  the non-convexity of the optimization problem, our proposed scheme improves various
  distortion and perceptual quality metrics from the conventional one-shot (non-iterative)
  Deep JSCC decoding baseline. Furthermore, the proposed scheme produces more reliable
  source reconstruction results compared to the baseline when the channel noise characteristics
  do not match the ones used during training.
