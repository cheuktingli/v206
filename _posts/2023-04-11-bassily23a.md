title: Principled Approaches for Private Adaptation from a Public Source
abstract: A key problem in a variety of applications is that of domain adaptation
  from a public source domain, for which a relatively large amount of labeled data
  with no privacy constraints is at oneâ€™s disposal, to a private target domain, for
  which a private sample is available with very few or no labeled data. In regression
  problems, where there are no privacy constraints on the source or target data, a
  discrepancy minimization approach was shown to outperform a number of other adaptation
  algorithm baselines. Building on that approach, we initiate a principled study of
  differentially private adaptation from a source domain with public labeled data
  to a target domain with unlabeled private data. We design differentially private
  discrepancy-based adaptation algorithms for this problem. The design and analysis
  of our private algorithms critically hinge upon several key properties we prove
  for a smooth approximation of the weighted discrepancy, such as its smoothness with
  respect to the $\ell_1$-norm and the sensitivity of its gradient. We formally show
  that our adaptation algorithms benefit from strong generalization and privacy guarantees.
