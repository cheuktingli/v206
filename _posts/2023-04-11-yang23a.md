title: Bayesian Structure Scores for Probabilistic Circuits
software: https://github.com/yangyang-pro/bayesian-scores-pc
abstract: Probabilistic circuits (PCs) are a prominent representation of probability
  distributions with tractable inference. While parameter learning in PCs is rigorously
  studied, structure learning is often more based on heuristics than on principled
  objectives. In this paper, we develop Bayesian structure scores for deterministic
  PCs, i.e., the structure likelihood with parameters marginalized out, which are
  well known as rigorous objectives for structure learning in probabilistic graphical
  models. When used within a greedy cutset algorithm, our scores effectively protect
  against overfitting and yield a fast and almost hyper-parameter-free structure learner,
  distinguishing it from previous approaches. In experiments, we achieve good trade-offs
  between training time and model fit in terms of log-likelihood. Moreover, the principled
  nature of Bayesian scores unlocks PCs for accommodating frameworks such as structural
  expectation-maximization.
