title: Particle algorithms for maximum likelihood training of latent variable models
software: https://github.com/juankuntz/ParEM
abstract: Neal and Hinton (1998) recast maximum likelihood estimation of any given
  latent variable model as the minimization of a free energy functional F, and the
  EM algorithm as coordinate descent applied to F. Here, we explore alternative ways
  to optimize the functional. In particular, we identify various gradient flows associated
  with F and show that their limits coincide with Fâ€™s stationary points. By discretizing
  the flows, we obtain practical particle-based algorithms for maximum likelihood
  estimation in broad classes of latent variable models. The novel algorithms scale
  to high-dimensional settings and perform well in numerical experiments.
