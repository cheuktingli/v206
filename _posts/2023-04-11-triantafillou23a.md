title: Learning Treatment Effects from Observational and Experimental Data
software: https://github.com/striantafillou/AISTATS2023
abstract: 'Decision making often depends on causal effect estimation. For example,
  clinical decisions are often based on estimates of the probability of post-treatment
  outcomes. Experimental data from randomized controlled trials allow for unbiased
  estimation of these probabilities. However, such data are usually limited in the
  number of samples and the set of measured covariates. Observational data, such as
  electronic medical records, contain many more samples and a richer set of measured
  covariates, which can be used to estimate more personalized treatment effects; however,
  these estimates may be biased due to latent confounding. In this work, we propose
  a Bayesian method for combining observational and experimental data for unbiased
  conditional treatment effect estimation. Our method addresses the following question:
  Given observational data $D_o$ measuring a set of covariates $\mathbf V$, and experimental
  data $D_e$ measuring a possibly smaller set of covariates $\mathbf{V_b}\subseteq
  \mathbf{V}$, which set of covariates $\mathbf{Z}$ leads to the optimal, unbiased
  prediction of the post-intervention outcome $P(Y |do(X), \mathbf{Z})$, and when
  can we use observational data for this estimation? In simulated data, we show that
  our method improves the prediction of post-intervention outcomes.'
