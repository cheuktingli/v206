title: Subset verification and search algorithms for causal DAGs
software: https://github.com/cxjdavin/subset-verification-and-search-algorithms-for-causal-DAGs
abstract: 'Learning causal relationships between variables is a fundamental task in
  causal inference and directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) are a popular choice to represent
  the causal relationships. As one can recover a causal graph only up to its Markov
  equivalence class from observations, interventions are often used for the recovery
  task. Interventions are costly in general and it is important to design algorithms
  that minimize the number of interventions performed. In this work, we study the
  problem of identifying the smallest set of interventions required to learn the causal
  relationships between a subset of edges (target edges). Under the assumptions of
  faithfulness, causal sufficiency, and ideal interventions, we study this problem
  in two settings: when the underlying ground truth causal graph is known (subset
  verification) and when it is unknown (subset search). For the subset verification
  problem, we provide an efficient algorithm to compute a minimum sized interventional
  set; we further extend these results to bounded size non-atomic interventions and
  node-dependent interventional costs. For the subset search problem, in the worst
  case, we show that no algorithm (even with adaptivity or randomization) can achieve
  an approximation ratio that is asymptotically better than the vertex cover of the
  target edges when compared with the subset verification number. This result is surprising
  as there exists a logarithmic approximation algorithm for the search problem when
  we wish to recover the whole causal graph. To obtain our results, we prove several
  interesting structural properties of interventional causal graphs that we believe
  have applications beyond the subset verification/search problems studied here.'
