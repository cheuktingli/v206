title: Stochastic Methods for AUC Optimization subject to AUC-based Fairness Constraints
software: https://github.com/yaoyao7/AUC-based-Fairness-Constraints
abstract: As machine learning being used increasingly in making high-stakes decisions,
  an arising challenge is to avoid unfair AI systems that lead to discriminatory decisions
  for protected population. A direct approach for obtaining a fair predictive model
  is to train the model through optimizing its prediction performance subject to fairness
  constraints. Among various fairness constraints, the ones based on the area under
  the ROC curve (AUC) are emerging recently because they are threshold-agnostic and
  effective for unbalanced data. In this work, we formulate the problem of training
  a fairness-aware predictive model as an AUC optimization problem subject to a class
  of AUC-based fairness constraints. This problem can be reformulated as a min-max
  optimization problem with min-max constraints, which we solve by stochastic first-order
  methods based on a new Bregman divergence designed for the special structure of
  the problem. We numerically demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on real-world
  data under different fairness metrics.
