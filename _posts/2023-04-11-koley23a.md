title: Differentiable Change-point Detection With Temporal Point Processes
software: https://github.com/paramita1024/Changepoint-TPP
abstract: In this paper, we consider the problem of global change-point detection
  in event sequence data, where both the event distributions and change-points are
  assumed to be unknown. For this problem, we propose a Log-likelihood Ratio based
  Global Change-point Detector, which observes the entire sequence and detects a prespecified
  number of change-points. Based on the Transformer Hawkes Process (THP), a well-known
  neural TPP framework, we develop DCPD, a differentiable change-point detector, along
  with maintaining distinct intensity and mark predictor for each partition. Further,
  we propose a sliding-window-based extension of DCPD to improve its scalability in
  terms of the number of events or change-points with minor sacrifices in performance.
  Experiments on synthetic datasets explore the effects of run-time, relative complexity,
  and other aspects of distributions on various properties of our changepoint detectors,
  namely robustness, detection accuracy, scalability, etc. under controlled environments.
  Finally, we perform experiments on six real-world temporal event sequences collected
  from diverse domains like health, geographical regions, etc., and show that our
  methods either outperform or perform comparably with the baselines.
