title: Robust and Agnostic Learning of Conditional Distributional Treatment Effects
software: https://github.com/CausalML/CDTE
abstract: The conditional average treatment effect (CATE) is the best measure of individual
  causal effects given baseline covariates. However, the CATE only captures the (conditional)
  average, and can overlook risks and tail events, which are important to treatment
  choice. In aggregate analyses, this is usually addressed by measuring the distributional
  treatment effect (DTE), such as differences in quantiles or tail expectations between
  treatment groups. Hypothetically, one can similarly fit conditional quantile regressions
  in each treatment group and take their difference, but this would not be robust
  to misspecification or provide agnostic best-in-class predictions. We provide a
  new robust and model-agnostic methodology for learning the conditional DTE (CDTE)
  for a class of problems that includes conditional quantile treatment effects, conditional
  super-quantile treatment effects, and conditional treatment effects on coherent
  risk measures given by f-divergences. Our method is based on constructing a special
  pseudo-outcome and regressing it on covariates using any regression learner. Our
  method is model-agnostic in that it can provide the best projection of CDTE onto
  the regression model class. Our method is robust in that even if we learn these
  nuisances nonparametrically at very slow rates, we can still learn CDTEs at rates
  that depend on the class complexity and even conduct inferences on linear projections
  of CDTEs. We investigate the behavior of our proposal in simulations, as well as
  in a case study of 401(k) eligibility effects on wealth.
