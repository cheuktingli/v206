title: 'Noisy Low-rank Matrix Optimization: Geometry of Local Minima and Convergence
  Rate'
software: https://github.com/anonpapersbm/Noisy-Low-rank-Matrix-Optimization
abstract: This paper is concerned with low-rank matrix optimization, which has found
  a wide range of applications in machine learning. This problem in the special case
  of matrix sensing has been studied extensively through the notion of Restricted
  Isometry Property (RIP), leading to a wealth of results on the geometric landscape
  of the problem and the convergence rate of common algorithms. However, the existing
  results can handle the problem in the case with a general objective function subject
  to noisy data only when the RIP constant is close to 0. In this paper, we develop
  a new mathematical framework to solve the above-mentioned problem with a far less
  restrictive RIP constant. We prove that as long as the RIP constant of the noiseless
  objective is less than 1/3, any spurious local solution of the noisy optimization
  problem must be close to the ground truth solution. By working through the strict
  saddle property, we also show that an approximate solution can be found in polynomial
  time. We characterize the geometry of the spurious local minima of the problem in
  a local region around the ground truth in the case when the RIP constant is greater
  than 1/3. Compared to the existing results in the literature, this paper offers
  the strongest RIP bound, and provides a complete theoretical analysis on the global
  and local optimization landscapes of general low-rank optimization problems under
  random corruptions from any finite-variance family.
