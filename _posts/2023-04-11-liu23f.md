title: 'INO: Invariant Neural Operators for Learning Complex Physical Systems with
  Momentum Conservation'
software: https://github.com/ningliu-iga/invariant_neural_operators
abstract: Neural operators, which emerge as implicit solution operators of hidden
  governing equations, have recently become popular tools for learning responses of
  complex real-world physical systems. Nevertheless, the majority of neural operator
  applications has thus far been data-driven, which neglects the intrinsic preservation
  of fundamental physical laws in data. In this paper, we introduce a novel integral
  neural operator architecture, to learn physical models with fundamental conservation
  laws automatically guaranteed. In particular, by replacing the frame-dependent position
  information with its invariant counterpart in the kernel space, the proposed neural
  operator is designed to be translation- and rotation-invariant, and consequently
  abides by the conservation laws of linear and angular momentums. As applications,
  we demonstrate the expressivity and efficacy of our model in learning complex material
  behaviors from both synthetic and experimental datasets, and show that, by automatically
  satisfying these essential physical laws, our learned neural operator is not only
  generalizable in handling translated and rotated datasets, but also achieves improved
  accuracy and efficiency from the baseline neural operator models.
