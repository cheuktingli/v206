title: Pointwise sampling uncertainties on the Precision-Recall curve
software: https://github.com/RUrlus/ModelMetricUncertainty
abstract: Quoting robust uncertainties on machine learning (ML) model metrics, such
  as f1-score, precision, recall, etc., from sources of uncertainty such as data sampling,
  parameter initialization, and target labelling, is typically not done in the field
  of data science, even though these are essential for the proper interpretation and
  comparison of ML models. This text shows how to calculate and visualize the impact
  of one dominant source of uncertainty - on each point of the Precision-Recall (PR)
  and Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves. This is particularly relevant
  for PR curves, where the joint uncertainty on recall and precision can be large
  and non-linear, especially at low recall. Four statistical methods to evaluate this
  uncertainty, both frequentist and Bayesian in origin, are compared in terms of coverage
  and speed. Of these, Wilks’ toolbox.
