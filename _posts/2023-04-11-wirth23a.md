title: Acceleration of Frank-Wolfe Algorithms with Open-Loop Step-Sizes
software: https://github.com/ZIB-IOL/open_loop_fw/releases/tag/v2.0.0
abstract: Frank-Wolfe algorithms (FW) are popular first-order methods for solving
  constrained convex optimization problems that rely on a linear minimization oracle
  instead of potentially expensive projection-like oracles. Many works have identified
  accelerated convergence rates under various structural assumptions on the optimization
  problem and for specific FW variants when using line-search or short-step, requiring
  feedback from the objective function. Little is known about accelerated convergence
  regimes when utilizing open-loop step-size rules, a.k.a. FW with pre-determined
  step-sizes, which are algorithmically extremely simple and stable. Not only is FW
  with open-loop step-size rules not always subject to the same convergence rate lower
  bounds as FW with line-search or short-step, but in some specific cases, such as
  kernel herding in infinite dimensions, it has been empirically observed that FW
  with open-loop step-size rules leads to faster convergence than FW with line-search
  or short-step. We propose a partial answer to this unexplained phenomenon in kernel
  herding, characterize a general setting for which FW with open-loop step-size rules
  converges non-asymptotically faster than with line-search or short-step, and derive
  several accelerated convergence results for FW with open-loop step-size rules.
