title: 'Dueling RL: Reinforcement Learning with Trajectory Preferences'
software: nan
abstract: We consider the problem of preference-based reinforcement learning (PbRL),
  where, unlike traditional reinforcement learning (RL), an agent receives feedback
  only in terms of 1 bit (0/1) preferences over a trajectory pair instead of absolute
  rewards for it. The success of the traditional reward-based RL framework crucially
  depends on how accurately a system designer can express an appropriate reward function,
  which is often a non-trivial task. The main novelty of the our framework is the
  ability to learn from preference-based trajectory feedback that eliminates the need
  to hand-craft numeric reward models. This paper sets up a formal framework for the
  PbRL problem with non-markovian rewards, where the trajectory preferences are encoded
  by a generalized linear model of dimension $d$. Assuming the transition model is
  known, we propose an algorithm with a regret guarantee of $\tilde {\mathcal{O}}\left(
  SH d \log (T / \delta) \sqrt{T} \right)$. We further extend the above algorithm
  to the case of unknown transition dynamics and provide an algorithm with regret
  $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}((\sqrt{d} + H^2 + |\mathcal{S}|)\sqrt{dT} +\sqrt{|\mathcal{S}||\mathcal{A}|TH}
  )$. To the best of our knowledge, our work is one of the first to give tight regret
  guarantees for preference-based RL problem with trajectory preferences.
