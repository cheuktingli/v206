title: Learning Sparse Graphon Mean Field Games
abstract: Although the field of multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has made
  considerable progress in the last years, solving systems with a large number of
  agents remains a hard challenge. Graphon mean field games (GMFGs) enable the scalable
  analysis of MARL problems that are otherwise intractable. By the mathematical structure
  of graphons, this approach is limited to dense graphs which are insufficient to
  describe many real-world networks such as power law graphs. Our paper introduces
  a novel formulation of GMFGs, called LPGMFGs, which leverages the graph theoretical
  concept of $L^p$ graphons and provides a machine learning tool to efficiently and
  accurately approximate solutions for sparse network problems. This especially includes
  power law networks which are empirically observed in various application areas and
  cannot be captured by standard graphons. We derive theoretical existence and convergence
  guarantees and give empirical examples that demonstrate the accuracy of our learning
  approach for systems with many agents. Furthermore, we extend the Online Mirror
  Descent (OMD) learning algorithm to our setup to accelerate learning speed, empirically
  show its capabilities, and conduct a theoretical analysis using the novel concept
  of smoothed step graphons. In general, we provide a scalable, mathematically well-founded
  machine learning approach to a large class of otherwise intractable problems of
  great relevance in numerous research fields.
