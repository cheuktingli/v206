title: Private Non-Convex Federated Learning Without a Trusted Server
software: https://github.com/ghafeleb/Private-NonConvex-Federated-Learning-Without-a-Trusted-Server
abstract: 'We study federated learning (FL) with non-convex loss functions and data
  from people who do not trust the server or other silos. In this setting, each silo
  (e.g. hospital) must protect the privacy of each person’s medical record), even
  if the server or other silos act as adversarial eavesdroppers. To that end, we consider
  inter-silo record-level (ISRL) differential privacy (DP), which requires silo $i$’s
  communications to satisfy record/item-level DP. We propose novel ISRL-DP algorithms
  for FL with heterogeneous (non-i.i.d.) silo data and two classes of Lipschitz continuous
  loss functions: First, we consider losses satisfying the Proximal Polyak-\Lojasiewicz
  (PL) inequality, which is an extension of the classical PL condition to the constrained
  setting. In contrast to our result, prior works only considered unconstrained private
  optimization with Lipschitz PL loss, which rules out most interesting PL losses
  such as strongly convex problems and linear/logistic regression. Our algorithms
  nearly attain the optimal strongly convex, homogeneous (i.i.d.) rate for ISRL-DP
  FL without assuming convexity or i.i.d. data. Second, we give the first private
  algorithms for non-convex non-smooth loss functions. Our utility bounds even improve
  on the state-of-the-art bounds for smooth losses. We complement our upper bounds
  with lower bounds. Additionally, we provide shuffle DP (SDP) algorithms that improve
  over the state-of-the-art central DP algorithms under more practical trust assumptions.
  Numerical experiments show that our algorithm has better accuracy than baselines
  for most privacy levels.'
