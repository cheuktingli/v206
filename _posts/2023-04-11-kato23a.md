title: 'Unified Perspective on Probability Divergence via the Density-Ratio Likelihood:
  Bridging KL-Divergence and Integral Probability Metrics'
abstract: This paper provides a unified perspective for the Kullback-Leibler (KL)-divergence
  and the integral probability metrics (IPMs) from the perspective of maximum likelihood
  density-ratio estimation (DRE). Both the KL-divergence and the IPMs are widely used
  in various fields in applications such as generative modeling. However, a unified
  understanding of these concepts has still been unexplored. In this paper, we show
  that the KL-divergence and the IPMs can be represented as maximal likelihoods differing
  only by sampling schemes, and use this result to derive a unified form of the IPMs
  and a relaxed estimation method. To develop the estimation problem, we construct
  an unconstrained maximum likelihood estimator to perform DRE with a stratified sampling
  scheme. We further propose a novel class of probability divergences, called the
  Density Ratio Metrics (DRMs), that interpolates the KL-divergence and the IPMs.
  In addition to these findings, we also introduce some applications of the DRMs,
  such as DRE and generative adversarial networks. In experiments, we validate the
  effectiveness of our proposed methods.
