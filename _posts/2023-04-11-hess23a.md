title: Fast Distributed k-Means with a Small Number of Rounds
software: https://github.com/selotape/distributed_k_means
abstract: We propose a new algorithm for k-means clustering in a distributed setting,
  where the data is distributed across many machines, and a coordinator communicates
  with these machines to calculate the output clustering. Our algorithm guarantees
  a cost approximation factor and a number of communication rounds that depend only
  on the computational capacity of the coordinator. Moreover, the algorithm includes
  a built-in stopping mechanism, which allows it to use fewer communication rounds
  whenever possible. We show both theoretically and empirically that in many natural
  cases, indeed 1-4 rounds suffice. In comparison with the popular k-means$||$ algorithm,
  our approach allows exploiting a larger coordinator capacity to obtain a smaller
  number of rounds. Our experiments show that the k-means cost obtained by the proposed
  algorithm is usually better than the cost obtained by k-means$||$, even when the
  latter is allowed a larger number of rounds. Moreover, the machine running time
  in our approach is considerably smaller than that of k-means$||$.
