title: Refined Convergence and Topology Learning for Decentralized SGD with Heterogeneous
  Data
abstract: One of the key challenges in decentralized and federated learning is to
  design algorithms that efficiently deal with highly heterogeneous data distributions
  across agents. In this paper, we revisit the analysis of Decentralized Stochastic
  Gradient Descent algorithm (D-SGD) under data heterogeneity. We exhibit the key
  role played by a new quantity, called neighborhood heterogeneity, on the convergence
  rate of D-SGD. By coupling the communication topology and the heterogeneity, our
  analysis sheds light on the poorly understood interplay between these two concepts.
  We then argue that neighborhood heterogeneity provides a natural criterion to learn
  data-dependent topologies that reduce (and can even eliminate) the otherwise detrimental
  effect of data heterogeneity on the convergence time of D-SGD. For the important
  case of classification with label skew, we formulate the problem of learning such
  a good topology as a tractable optimization problem that we solve with a Frank-Wolfe
  algorithm. As illustrated over a set of simulated and real-world experiments, our
  approach provides a principled way to design a sparse topology that balances the
  convergence speed and the per-iteration communication costs of D-SGD under data
  heterogeneity.
