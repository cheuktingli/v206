title: 'SurvivalGAN: Generating Time-to-Event Data for Survival Analysis'
software: https://github.com/vanderschaarlab/survivalgan
abstract: 'Synthetic data is becoming an increasingly promising technology, and successful
  applications can improve privacy, fairness, and data democratization. While there
  are many methods for generating synthetic tabular data, the task remains non-trivial
  and unexplored for specific scenarios. One such scenario is survival data. Here,
  the key difficulty is censoring: for some instances, we are not aware of the time
  of event, or if one even occurred. Imbalances in censoring and time horizons cause
  generative models to experience three new failure modes specific to survival analysis:
  (1) generating too few at-risk members; (2) generating too many at-risk members;
  and (3) censoring too early. We formalize these failure modes and provide three
  new generative metrics to quantify them. Following this, we propose SurvivalGAN,
  a generative model that handles survival data firstly by addressing the imbalance
  in the censoring and event horizons, and secondly by using a dedicated mechanism
  for approximating time-to-event/censoring. We evaluate this method via extensive
  experiments on medical datasets. SurvivalGAN outperforms multiple baselines at generating
  survival data, and in particular addresses the failure modes as measured by the
  new metrics, in addition to improving downstream performance of survival models
  trained on the synthetic data.'
