title: Doubly Fair Dynamic Pricing
abstract: 'We study the problem of online dynamic pricing with two types of fairness
  constraints: a “procedural fairness” which requires the “proposed” prices to be
  equal in expectation among different groups, and a “substantive fairness” which
  requires the “accepted” prices to be equal in expectation among different groups.
  A policy that is simultaneously procedural and substantive fair is referred to as
  “doubly fair”. We show that a doubly fair policy must be random to have higher revenue
  than the best trivial policy that assigns the same price to different groups. In
  a two-group setting, we propose an online learning algorithm for the 2-group pricing
  problems that achieves $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ regret, zero procedural unfairness
  and $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ substantive unfairness over $T$ rounds of learning. We
  also prove two lower bounds showing that these results on regret and unfairness
  are both information-theoretically optimal up to iterated logarithmic factors. To
  the best of our knowledge, this is the first dynamic pricing algorithm that learns
  to price while satisfying two fairness constraints at the same time.'
