title: Asymptotically Unbiased Off-Policy Policy Evaluation when Reusing Old Data
  in Nonstationary Environments
software: https://github.com/VincentLiu3/NonstationaryOPE
abstract: In this work, we consider the off-policy policy evaluation problem for contextual
  bandits and finite horizon reinforcement learning in the nonstationary setting.
  Reusing old data is critical for policy evaluation, but existing estimators that
  reuse old data introduce large bias such that we can not obtain a valid confidence
  interval. Inspired from a related field called survey sampling, we introduce a variant
  of the doubly robust (DR) estimator, called the regression-assisted DR estimator,
  that can incorporate the past data without introducing a large bias. The estimator
  unifies several existing off-policy policy evaluation methods and improves on them
  with the use of auxiliary information and a regression approach. We prove that the
  new estimator is asymptotically unbiased, and provide a consistent variance estimator
  to a construct a large sample confidence interval. Finally, we empirically show
  that the new estimator improves estimation for the current and future policy values,
  and provides a tight and valid interval estimation in several nonstationary recommendation
  environments.
