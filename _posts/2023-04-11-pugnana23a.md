title: AUC-based Selective Classification
software: https://github.com/andrepugni/AUCbasedSelectiveClassification
abstract: Selective classification (or classification with a reject option) pairs
  a classifier with a selection function to determine whether or not a prediction
  should be accepted. This framework trades off coverage (probability of accepting
  a prediction) with predictive performance, typically measured by distributive loss
  functions. In many application scenarios, such as credit scoring, performance is
  instead measured by ranking metrics, such as the Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC).
  We propose a model-agnostic approach to associate a selection function to a given
  probabilistic binary classifier. The approach is specifically targeted at optimizing
  the AUC. We provide both theoretical justifications and a novel algorithm, called
  AUCROSS, to achieve such a goal. Experiments show that our method succeeds in trading-off
  coverage for AUC, improving over existing selective classification methods targeted
  at optimizing accuracy.
