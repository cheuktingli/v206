title: Vector Quantized Time Series Generation with a Bidirectional Prior Model
software: https://github.com/ML4ITS/TimeVQVAE
abstract: 'Time series generation (TSG) studies have mainly focused on the use of
  Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) combined with recurrent neural network (RNN)
  variants. However, the fundamental limitations and challenges of training GANs still
  remain. In addition, the RNN-family typically has difficulties with temporal consistency
  between distant timesteps. Motivated by the successes in the image generation (IMG)
  domain, we propose TimeVQVAE, the first work, to our knowledge, that uses vector
  quantization (VQ) techniques to address the TSG problem. Moreover, the priors of
  the discrete latent spaces are learned with bidirectional transformer models that
  can better capture global temporal consistency. We also propose VQ modeling in a
  time-frequency domain, separated into low-frequency (LF) and high-frequency (HF).
  This allows us to retain important characteristics of the time series and, in turn,
  generate new synthetic signals that are of better quality, with sharper changes
  in modularity, than its competing TSG methods. Our experimental evaluation is conducted
  on all datasets from the UCR archive, using well-established metrics in the IMG
  literature, such as Frechet inception distance and inception scores. Our implementation
