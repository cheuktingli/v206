title: Alternating Projected SGD for Equality-constrained Bilevel Optimization
software: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/EAIPOD-76F2/README.md
abstract: Bilevel optimization, which captures the inherent nested structure of machine
  learning problems, is gaining popularity in many recent applications. Existing works
  on bilevel optimization mostly consider either the unconstrained problems or the
  constrained upper-level problems. In this context, this paper considers the stochastic
  bilevel optimization problems with equality constraints in both upper and lower
  levels. By leveraging the special structure of the equality constraints problem,
  the paper first presents an alternating projected SGD approach to tackle this problem
  and establishes the $\tilde{\cal O}(\epsilon^{-2})$ sample and iteration complexity
  that matches the state-of-the-art complexity of ALSET Chen et al. (2021) for stochastic
  unconstrained bilevel problems. To further save the cost of projection, the paper
  presents an alternating projected SGD approach with lazy projection and establishes
  the $\tilde{\cal O}(\epsilon^{-2}/T)$ upper-level and $\tilde{\cal O}(\epsilon^{-1.5}/T^{\frac{3}{4}})$
  lower-level projection complexity of this new algorithm, where $T$ is the upper-level
  projection interval. Application to federated bilevel optimization has been presented
  to showcase the performance of our algorithms. Our results demonstrate that equality-constrained
  bilevel optimization with strongly-convex lower-level problems can be solved as
  efficiently as stochastic single-level optimization problems.
