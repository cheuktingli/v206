title: Stochastic Mirror Descent for Large-Scale Sparse Recovery
abstract: We discuss an application of Stochastic Approximation to statistical estimation
  of high-dimensional sparse parameters. The proposed solution reduces to resolving
  a penalized stochastic optimization problem on each stage of a multistage algorithm;
  each problem being solved to a prescribed accuracy by the non-Euclidean Composite
  Stochastic Mirror Descent (CSMD) algorithm. Assuming that the problem objective
  is smooth and quadratically minorated and stochastic perturbations are sub-Gaussian,
  our analysis prescribes the method parameters which ensure fast convergence of the
  estimation error (the radius of a confidence ball of a given norm around the approximate
  solution). This convergence is linear during the first “preliminary” phase of the
  routine and is sublinear during the second “asymptotic” phase. We consider an application
  of the proposed approach to sparse Generalized Linear Regression problem. In this
  setting, we show that the proposed algorithm attains the optimal convergence of
  the estimation error under weak assumptions on the regressor distribution. We also
  present a numerical study illustrating the performance of the algorithm on high-dimensional
  simulation data.
