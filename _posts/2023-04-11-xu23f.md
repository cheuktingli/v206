title: Oblivious near-optimal sampling for multidimensional signals with Fourier constraints
abstract: We study the problem of reconstructing a continuous multidimensional signal
  from a small number of samples under Fourier constraints assuming that the Fourier
  power spectrum of the signal has some desirable properties, e.g. being compactly
  supported, being sparse. We further assume that the Fourier constraint can be expressed
  as a prior distribution on the Fourier power spectrum, which subsumes the aforementioned
  examples. The study of sampling and reconstructing in this vein has attracted much
  attention with a long history. In this paper, we are interested in finding oblivious
  sampling strategies, that is, sampling without knowing what specific constraint
  is put on the Fourier power spectrum. We show that it is possible to obliviously
  sample a Fourier-constrained multidimensional signal with a near-optimal (up to
  a logarithmic factor) number of samples that guarantee successful reconstruction,
  partially answering an open question in Avron et al. (2019) which considered the
  $1$-dimensional case. Our approach highlights a phenomenon that is unique for dimension
  $d\ge 2$ that the sampling strategy should depend on the geometry of the region
  on which the signal is to be reconstructed, unlike the case $d=1$ where all regions
  are of the form $[a,b]$ which are all geometrically equivalent. Our proof, using
  tools from convex geometry, also illuminates an idea obscured in $d=1$, that to
  reconstruct a signal in a given region, it can be helpful to take some samples outside
  that region.
