title: Using Sliced Mutual Information to Study Memorization and Generalization in
  Deep Neural Networks
software: https://github.com/kentridgeai/SMI-DNN
abstract: In this paper, we study the memorization and generalization behaviour of
  deep neural networks (DNNs) using sliced mutual information (SMI), which is the
  average of the mutual information (MI) between one-dimensional random projections.
  We argue that the SMI between features in a DNN ($T$) and ground truth labels ($Y$),
  $SI(T;Y)$, can be seen as a form of usable information that the features contain
  about the labels. We show theoretically that $SI(T;Y)$ can encode geometric properties
  of the feature distribution, such as its spherical soft-margin and intrinsic dimensionality,
  in a way that MI cannot. Additionally, we present empirical evidence showing how
  $SI(T;Y)$ can capture memorization and generalization in DNNs. In particular, we
  find that, in the presence of label noise, all layers start to memorize but the
  earlier layers stabilize more quickly than the deeper layers. Finally, we point
  out that, in the context of Bayesian Neural Networks, the SMI between the penultimate
  layer and the output represents the worst case uncertainty of the networkâ€™s output.
