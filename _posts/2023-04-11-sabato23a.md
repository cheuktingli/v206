title: Improved Robust Algorithms for Learning with Discriminative Feature Feedback
abstract: Discriminative Feature Feedback is a setting first introduced by Dasgupta
  et al. (2018), which provides a protocol for interactive learning based on feature
  explanations that are provided by a human teacher. The features distinguish between
  the labels of pairs of possibly similar instances. That work has shown that learning
  in this model can have considerable statistical and computational advantages over
  learning in standard label-based interactive learning models. In this work, we provide
  new robust interactive learning algorithms for the Discriminative Feature Feedback
  model, with mistake bounds that are significantly lower than those of previous robust
  algorithms for this setting. In the adversarial setting, we reduce the dependence
  on the number of protocol exceptions from quadratic to linear. In addition, we provide
  an algorithm for a slightly more restricted model, which obtains an even smaller
  mistake bound for large models with many exceptions. In the stochastic setting,
  we provide the first algorithm that converges to the exception rate with a polynomial
  sample complexity. Our algorithm and analysis for the stochastic setting involve
  a new construction that we call Feature Influence, which may be of wider applicability.
