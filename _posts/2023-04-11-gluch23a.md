title: Breaking a Classical Barrier for Classifying Arbitrary Test Examples in the
  Quantum Model
abstract: A new model for adversarial robustness was introduced by Goldwasser et al.
  in [GKKM20]. In this model the authors present a selective and transductive learning
  algorithm which guarantees a low test error and low rejection rate wrt to the original
  distribution. Moreover, a lower bound in terms of the VC-dimension, the standard
  risk and the number of samples is derived. We show that this lower bound can be
  broken in the quantum world. We consider a new model, influenced by the quantum
  PAC-learning model introduced by [BJ95], and similar in spirit to the one in [GKKM20].
  In this model we give an interactive protocol between the learner and the adversary
  (at test-time) that guarantees robustness. This protocol, when applied, breaks the
  lower bound from [GKKM20]. From the technical perspective, our protocol is inspired
  by recent advances in delegation of quantum computation, e.g. [Mah18]. But in order
  to be applicable to our task, we extend the delegation protocol to enable a new
  feature, e.g. by extending delegation of decision problems, i.e. BQP, to sampling
  problems with adversarially chosen inputs.
