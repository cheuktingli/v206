title: Adaptive Dimension Reduction and Variational Inference for Transductive Few-Shot
  Classification
software: https://github.com/yhu01/BAVARDAGE
abstract: Transductive Few-Shot learning has gained increased attention nowadays considering
  the cost of data annotations along with the increased accuracy provided by unlabelled
  samples in the domain of few shot. Especially in Few-Shot Classification (FSC),
  recent works explore the feature distributions aiming at maximizing likelihoods
  or posteriors with respect to the unknown parameters. Following this vein, and considering
  the parallel between FSC and clustering, we seek for better taking into account
  the uncertainty in estimation due to lack of data, as well as better statistical
  properties of the clusters associated with each class. Therefore in this paper we
  propose a new clustering method based on Variational Bayesian inference, further
  improved by Adaptive Dimension Reduction based on Probabilistic Linear Discriminant
  Analysis. Our proposed method significantly improves accuracy in the realistic unbalanced
  transductive setting on various Few-Shot benchmarks when applied to features used
  in previous studies, with a gain of up to $6%$ in accuracy. In addition, when applied
  to balanced setting, we obtain very competitive results without making use of the
  class-balance artefact which is disputable for practical use cases.
