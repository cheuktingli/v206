title: Probabilistic Querying of Continuous-Time Event Sequences
software: https://github.com/ajboyd2/point_process_queries
abstract: Continuous-time event sequences, i.e., sequences consisting of continuous
  time stamps and associated event types (“marks”), are an important type of sequential
  data with many applications, e.g., in clinical medicine or user behavior modeling.
  Since these data are typically modeled in an autoregressive manner (e.g., using
  neural Hawkes processes or their classical counterparts), it is natural to ask questions
  about future scenarios such as “what kind of event will occur next” or “will an
  event of type $A$ occur before one of type $B$.” Addressing such queries with direct
  methods such as naive simulation can be highly inefficient from a computational
  perspective. This paper introduces a new typology of query types and a framework
  for addressing them using importance sampling. Example queries include predicting
  the $n^\mathrm{th}$ event type in a sequence and the hitting time distribution of
  one or more event types. We also leverage these findings further to be applicable
  for estimating general “$A$ before $B$” type of queries. We prove theoretically
  that our estimation method is effectively always better than naive simulation and
  demonstrate empirically based on three real-world datasets that our approach can
  produce orders of magnitude improvements in sampling efficiency compared to naive
  methods.
