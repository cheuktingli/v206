title: Coarse-Grained Smoothness for Reinforcement Learning in Metric Spaces
abstract: Principled decision-making in continuous stateâ€“action spaces is impossible
  without some assumptions. A common approach is to assume Lipschitz continuity of
  the Q-function. We show that, unfortunately, this property fails to hold in many
  typical domains. We propose a new coarse-grained smoothness definition that generalizes
  the notion of Lipschitz continuity, is more widely applicable, and allows us to
  compute significantly tighter bounds on Q-functions, leading to improved learning.
  We provide a theoretical analysis of our new smoothness definition, and discuss
  its implications and impact on control and exploration in continuous domains.
