title: Mode-constrained Model-based Reinforcement Learning via Gaussian Processes
software: https://github.com/aidanscannell/moderl
abstract: Model-based reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms do not typically consider
  environments with multiple dynamic modes, where it is beneficial to avoid inoperable
  or undesirable modes. We present a model-based RL algorithm that constrains training
  to a single dynamic mode with high probability. This is a difficult problem because
  the mode constraint is a hidden variable associated with the environmentâ€™s dynamics.
  As such, it is 1) unknown a priori and 2) we do not observe its output from the
  environment, so cannot learn it with supervised learning. We present a nonparametric
  dynamic model which learns the mode constraint alongside the dynamic modes. Importantly,
  it learns latent structure that our planning scheme leverages to 1) enforce the
  mode constraint with high probability, and 2) escape local optima induced by the
  mode constraint. We validate our method by showing that it can solve a simulated
  quadcopter navigation task whilst providing a level of constraint satisfaction both
  during and after training.
