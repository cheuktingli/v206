title: Precision/Recall on Imbalanced Test Data
abstract: In this paper we study the problem of estimating accurately the precision
  and recall for binary classification when the classes are imbalanced and only a
  limited number of human labels are available. One common strategy is to over-sample
  the small positive class predicted by the classifier. Rather than random sampling
  where the values in a confusion matrix are observations coming from a multinomial
  distribution, we over-sample the minority positive class predicted by the classifier,
  resulting in two independent binomial distributions. But how much should we over-sample?
  And what confidence/credible intervals can we deduce based on our over-sampling?
  We provide formulas for (1) the confidence intervals of the adjusted precision/recall
  after over-sampling; (2) Bayesian credible intervals of adjusted precision/recall.
  For precision, the higher the over-sampling rate, the narrower the confidence/credible
  interval. For recall, there exists an optimal over-sampling ratio, which minimizes
  the width of the confidence/credible interval. Also, we present experiments on synthetic
  data and real data to demonstrate the capability of our method to construct accurate
  intervals. Finally, we demonstrate how we can apply our techniques to Yahoo mailâ€™s
  quality monitoring system.
