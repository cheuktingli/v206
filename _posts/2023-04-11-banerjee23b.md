title: Exploration in Linear Bandits with Rich Action Sets and its Implications for
  Inference

abstract: We present a non-asymptotic lower bound on the spectrum of the design matrix
  generated by any linear bandit algorithm with sub-linear regret when the action
  set has well-behaved curvature. Specifically, we show that the minimum eigenvalue
  of the expected design matrix grows as $\Omega(\sqrt{n})$ whenever the expected
  cumulative regret of the algorithm is $O(\sqrt{n})$, where $n$ is the learning horizon,
  and the action-space has a constant Hessian around the optimal arm. This shows that
  such action-spaces force a polynomial lower bound on the least eigenvalue, rather
  than a logarithmic lower bound as shown by Lattimore et al. (2017) for discrete
  (i.e., well-separated) action spaces. Furthermore, while the latter holds only in
  the asymptotic regime ($n \to \infty$), our result for these “locally rich” action
  spaces is any-time. Additionally, under a mild technical assumption, we obtain a
  similar lower bound on the minimum eigen value holding with high probability. We
  apply our result to two practical scenarios – model selection and clustering in
  linear bandits. For model selection, we show that an epoch-based linear bandit algorithm
  adapts to the true model complexity at a rate exponential in the number of epochs,
  by virtue of our novel spectral bound. For clustering, we consider a multi agent
  framework where we show, by leveraging the spectral result, that no forced exploration
  is necessary—the agents can run a linear bandit algorithm and estimate their underlying
  parameters at once, and hence incur a low regret.
