title: Incentive-aware Contextual Pricing with Non-parametric Market Noise
software: nan
abstract: We consider a dynamic pricing problem for repeated contextual second-price
  auctions with multiple strategic buyers who aim to maximize their long-term time
  discounted utility. The seller has limited information on buyers’ overall demand
  curves which depends on a non-parametric market-noise distribution, and buyers may
  potentially submit corrupted bids (relative to true valuations) to manipulate the
  seller’s pricing policy for more favorable reserve prices in the future. We focus
  on designing the seller’s learning policy to set contextual reserve prices where
  the seller’s goal is to minimize regret compared to the revenue of a benchmark clairvoyant
  policy that has full information of buyers’ demand. We propose a policy with a phased-structure
  that incorporates randomized “isolation” periods, during which a buyer is randomly
  chosen to solely participate in the auction. We show that this design allows the
  seller to control the number of periods in which buyers significantly corrupt their
  bids. We then prove that our policy enjoys a T-period regret of $O(\sqrt{T})$ facing
  strategic buyers. Finally, we conduct numerical simulations to compare our proposed
  algorithm to standard pricing policies. Our numerical results show that our algorithm
  outperforms these policies under various buyer bidding behavior.
