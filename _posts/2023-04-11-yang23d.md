  MaxWeight with Discounted UCB'

abstract: Multi-server queueing systems are widely used models for job scheduling
  in machine learning, wireless networks, and crowdsourcing. This paper considers
  a multi-server system with multiple servers and multiple types of jobs, where different
  job types require different amounts of processing time at different servers. The
  goal is to schedule jobs on servers without knowing the statistics of the processing
  times. To fully utilize the processing power of the servers, it is known that one
  has to at least learn the service rates of different job types on different servers.
  Prior works on this topic decouple the learning and scheduling phases which leads
  to either excessive exploration or extremely large job delays. We propose a new
  algorithm, which combines the MaxWeight scheduling policy with discounted upper
  confidence bound (UCB), to simultaneously learn the statistics and schedule jobs
  to servers. We obtain performance bounds for our algorithm that hold for both stationary
  and nonstationary service rates. Simulations confirm that the delay performance
  of our algorithm is several orders of magnitude better than previously proposed
  algorithms. Our algorithm also has the added benefit that it can handle non-stationarity
  in the service processes.
