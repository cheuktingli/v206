title: Fair Representation Learning with Unreliable Labels
abstract: In learning with fairness, for every instance, its label can be randomly
  flipped to another class due to the practitionerâ€™s prejudice, namely, label bias.
  The existing well-studied fair representation learning methods focus on removing
  the dependency between the sensitive factors and the input data, but do not address
  how the representations retain useful information when the labels are unreliable.
  In fact, we find that the learned representations become random or degenerated when
  the instance is contaminated by label bias. To alleviate this issue, we investigate
  the problem of learning fair representations that are independent of the sensitive
  factors while retaining the task-relevant information given only access to unreliable
  labels. Our model disentangles the dependency between fair representations and sensitive
  factors in the latent space. To remove the reliance between the labels and sensitive
  factors, we incorporate an additional penalty based on mutual information. The learned
  purged fair representations can then be used in any downstream processing. We demonstrate
  the superiority of our method over previous works through multiple experiments on
  both synthetic and real-world datasets.
