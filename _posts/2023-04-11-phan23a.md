title: Global-Local Regularization Via Distributional Robustness
software: https://github.com/VietHoang1512/GLOT
abstract: Despite superior performance in many situations, deep neural networks are
  often vulnerable to adversarial examples and distribution shifts, limiting model
  generalization ability in real-world applications. To alleviate these problems,
  recent approaches leverage distributional robustness optimization (DRO) to find
  the most challenging distribution, and then minimize loss function over this most
  challenging distribution. Regardless of having achieved some improvements, these
  DRO approaches have some obvious limitations. First, they purely focus on local
  regularization to strengthen model robustness, missing a global regularization effect
  that is useful in many real-world applications (e.g., domain adaptation, domain
  generalization, and adversarial machine learning). Second, the loss functions in
  the existing DRO approaches operate in only the most challenging distribution, hence
  decouple with the original distribution, leading to a restrictive modeling capability.
  In this paper, we propose a novel regularization technique, following the veins
  of Wasserstein-based DRO framework. Specifically, we define a particular joint distribution
  and Wasserstein-based uncertainty, allowing us to couple the original and most challenging
  distributions for enhancing modeling capability and applying both local and global
  regularizations. Empirical studies on different learning problems demonstrate that
  our proposed approach significantly outperforms the existing regularization approaches
  in various domains.
