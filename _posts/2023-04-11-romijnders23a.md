title: 'No time to waste: practical statistical contact tracing with few low-bit messages'
software: https://github.com/QUVA-Lab/nttw
abstract: Pandemics have a major impact on society and the economy. In the case of
  a new virus, such as COVID-19, high-grade tests and vaccines might be slow to develop
  and scarce in the crucial initial phase. With no time to waste and lock-downs being
  expensive, contact tracing is thus an essential tool for policymakers. In theory,
  statistical inference on a virus transmission model can provide an effective method
  for tracing infections. However, in practice, such algorithms need to run decentralized,
  rendering existing methods – that require hundreds or even thousands of daily messages
  per person – infeasible. In this paper, we develop an algorithm that (i) requires
  only a few (2-5) daily messages, (ii) works with extremely low bandwidths (3-5 bits)
  and (iii) enables quarantining and targeted testing that drastically reduces the
  peak and length of the pandemic. We compare the effectiveness of our algorithm using
  two agent-based simulators of realistic contact patterns and pandemic parameters
  and show that it performs well even with low bandwidth, imprecise tests, and incomplete
  population coverage.
