title: A Contrastive Approach to Online Change Point Detection
software: https://github.com/npuchkin/contrastive_change_point_detection
abstract: We suggest a novel procedure for online change point detection. Our approach
  expands an idea of maximizing a discrepancy measure between points from pre-change
  and post-change distributions. This leads to a flexible procedure suitable for both
  parametric and nonparametric scenarios. We prove non-asymptotic bounds on the average
  running length of the procedure and its expected detection delay. The efficiency
  of the algorithm is illustrated with numerical experiments on synthetic and real-world
  data sets.
