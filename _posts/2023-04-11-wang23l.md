title: A Targeted Accuracy Diagnostic for Variational Approximations
software: https://github.com/TARPS-group/TADDAA
abstract: Variational Inference (VI) is an attractive alternative to Markov Chain
  Monte Carlo (MCMC) due to its computational efficiency in the case of large datasets
  and/or complex models with high-dimensional parameters. However, evaluating the
  accuracy of variational approximations remains a challenge. Existing methods characterize
  the quality of the whole variational distribution, which is almost always poor in
  realistic applications, even if specific posterior functionals such as the component-wise
  means or variances are accurate. Hence, these diagnostics are of practical value
  only in limited circumstances. To address this issue, we propose the“TArgeted Diagnostic
  for Distribution Approximation Accuracy” (TADDAA), which uses many short parallel
  MCMC chains to obtain lower bounds on the error of each posterior functional of
  interest. We also develop a reliability check for TADDAA to determine when the lower
  bounds should not be trusted. Numerical experiments validate the practical utility
  and computational efficiency of our approach on a range of synthetic distributions
  and real-data examples, including sparse logistic regression and Bayesian neural
  network models.
