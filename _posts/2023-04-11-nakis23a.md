title: Characterizing Polarization in Social Networks using the Signed Relational
  Latent Distance Model
software: https://github.com/Nicknakis/SLIM_RAA
abstract: 'Graph representation learning has become a prominent tool for the characterization
  and understanding of the structure of networks in general and social networks in
  particular. Typically, these representation learning approaches embed the networks
  into a low-dimensional space in which the role of each individual can be characterized
  in terms of their latent position. A major current concern in social networks is
  the emergence of polarization and filter bubbles promoting a mindset of ”us-versus-them”
  that may be defined by extreme positions believed to ultimately lead to political
  violence and the erosion of democracy. Such polarized networks are typically characterized
  in terms of signed links reflecting likes and dislikes. We propose the Signed Latent
  Distance Model (SLDM) utilizing for the first time the Skellam distribution as a
  likelihood function for signed networks. We further extend the modeling to the characterization
  of distinct extreme positions by constraining the embedding space to polytopes,
  forming the Signed Latent Relational Distance Model (SLIM). On four real social
  signed networks of polarization, we demonstrate that the models extract low-dimensional
  characterizations that well predict friendships and animosity while SLIM provides
  interpretable visualizations defined by extreme positions when restricting the embedding
  space to polytopes. '
