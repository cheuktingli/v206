title: 'BaCaDI: Bayesian Causal Discovery with Unknown Interventions'
software: https://github.com/haeggee/bacadi
abstract: Inferring causal structures from experimentation is a central task in many
  domains. For example, in biology, recent advances allow us to obtain single-cell
  expression data under multiple interventions such as drugs or gene knockouts. However,
  the targets of the interventions are often uncertain or unknown and the number of
  observations limited. As a result, standard causal discovery methods can no longer
  be reliably used. To fill this gap, we propose a Bayesian framework (BaCaDI) for
  discovering and reasoning about the causal structure that underlies data generated
  under various unknown experimental or interventional conditions. BaCaDI is fully
  differentiable, which allows us to infer the complex joint posterior over the intervention
  targets and the causal structure via efficient gradient-based variational inference.
  In experiments on synthetic causal discovery tasks and simulated gene-expression
  data, BaCaDI outperforms related methods in identifying causal structures and intervention
  targets.
