title: Scalable marked point processes for exchangeable and non-exchangeable event
  sequences
software: https://github.com/aresPanos/Interpretable-Point-Processes
abstract: We adopt the interpretability offered by a parametric, Hawkes-process-inspired
  conditional probability mass function for the marks and apply variational inference
  techniques to derive a general and scalable inferential framework for marked point
  processes. The framework can handle both exchangeable and non-exchangeable event
  sequences with minimal tuning and without any pre-training. This contrasts with
  many parametric and non-parametric state-of-the-art methods that typically require
  pre-training and/or careful tuning, and can only handle exchangeable event sequences.
  The frameworkâ€™s competitive computational and predictive performance against other
  state-of-the-art methods are illustrated through real data experiments. Its attractiveness
  for large-scale applications is demonstrated through a case study involving all
  events occurring in an English Premier League season.
