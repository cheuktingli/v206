title: Context-Specific Causal Discovery for Categorical Data Using Staged Trees
software: https://github.com/gherardovarando/stagedtrees_causal
abstract: Causal discovery algorithms aim at untangling complex causal relationships
  from data. Here, we study causal discovery and inference methods based on staged
  tree models, which can represent complex and asymmetric causal relationships between
  categorical variables. We provide a first graphical representation of the equivalence
  class of a staged tree, by looking only at a specific subset of its underlying independences.
  We further define a new pre-metric, inspired by the widely used structural intervention
  distance, to quantify the closeness between two staged trees in terms of their corresponding
  causal inference statements. A simulation study highlights the efficacy of staged
  trees in uncovering complexes, asymmetric causal relationships from data, and real-world
  data applications illustrate their use in practical causal analysis.
