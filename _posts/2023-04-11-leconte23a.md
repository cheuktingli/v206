title: 'ASkewSGD : An Annealed interval-constrained Optimisation method to train Quantized
  Neural Networks'
abstract: In this paper, we develop a new algorithm, Annealed Skewed SGD - AskewSGD
  - for training deep neural networks (DNNs) with quantized weights. First, we formulate
  the training of quantized neural networks (QNNs) as a smoothed sequence of interval-constrained
  optimization problems. Then, we propose a new first-order stochastic method, AskewSGD,
  to solve each constrained optimization subproblem. Unlike algorithms with active
  sets and feasible directions, AskewSGD avoids projections or optimization under
  the entire feasible set and allows iterates that are infeasible. The numerical complexity
  of AskewSGD is comparable to existing approaches for training QNNs, such as the
  straight-through gradient estimator used in BinaryConnect, or other state of the
  art methods (ProxQuant, LUQ). We establish convergence guarantees for AskewSGD (under
  general assumptions for the objective function). Experimental results show that
  the AskewSGD algorithm performs better than or on par with state of the art methods
  in classical benchmarks.
