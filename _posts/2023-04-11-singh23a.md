title: Nonparametric Indirect Active Learning
software: https://gitlab.tuebingen.mpg.de/shashank/indirect-active-learning
abstract: Typical models of active learning assume a learner can directly manipulate
  or query a covariate X to study its relationship with a response Y. However, if
  X is a feature of a complex system, it may be possible only to indirectly influence
  X by manipulating a control variable Z, a scenario we refer to as Indirect Active
  Learning. Under a nonparametric fixed-budget model of Indirect Active Learning,
  we study minimax convergence rates for estimating a local relationship between X
  and Y, with different rates depending on the complexities and noise levels of the
  relationships between Z and X and between X and Y. We also derive minimax rates
  for passive learning under comparable assumptions, finding in many cases that, while
  there is an asymptotic benefit to active learning, this benefit is fully realized
  by a simple two-stage learner that runs two passive experiments in sequence.
