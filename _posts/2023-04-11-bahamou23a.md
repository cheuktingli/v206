title: A Mini-Block Fisher Method for Deep Neural Networks
software: https://github.com/achrafba96/mbf
abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are currently predominantly trained using first-order
  methods. Some of these methods (e.g., Adam, AdaGrad, and RMSprop, and their variants)
  incorporate a small amount of curvature information by using a diagonal matrix to
  precondition the stochastic gradient. Recently, effective second-order methods,
  such as KFAC, K-BFGS, Shampoo, and TNT, have been developed for training DNNs, by
  preconditioning the stochastic gradient by layer-wise block-diagonal matrices. Here
  we propose a “mini-block Fisher (MBF)” preconditioned stochastic gradient method,
  that lies in between these two classes of methods. Specifically, our method uses
  a block-diagonal approximation to the empirical Fisher matrix, where for each layer
  in the DNN, whether it is convolutional or feed-forward and fully connected, the
  associated diagonal block is itself block-diagonal and is composed of a large number
  of mini-blocks of modest size. Our novel approach utilizes the parallelism of GPUs
  to efficiently perform computations on the large number of matrices in each layer.
  Consequently, MBF’s per-iteration computational cost is only slightly higher than
  it is for first-order methods. The performance of MBF is compared to that of several
  baseline methods, on Autoencoder, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and Graph
  Convolutional Network (GCN) problems, to validate its effectiveness both in terms
  of time efficiency and generalization power. Finally, it is proved that an idealized
  version of MBF converges linearly.
