title: A Tale of Sampling and Estimation in Discounted Reinforcement Learning
abstract: The most relevant problems in discounted reinforcement learning involve
  estimating the mean of a function under the stationary distribution of a Markov
  reward process, such as the expected return in policy evaluation, or the policy
  gradient in policy optimization. In practice, these estimates are produced through
  a finite-horizon episodic sampling, which neglects the mixing properties of the
  Markov process. It is mostly unclear how this mismatch between the practical and
  the ideal setting affects the estimation, and the literature lacks a formal study
  on the pitfalls of episodic sampling, and how to do it optimally. In this paper,
  we present a minimax lower bound on the discounted mean estimation problem that
  explicitly connects the estimation error with the mixing properties of the Markov
  process and the discount factor. Then, we provide a statistical analysis on a set
  of notable estimators and the corresponding sampling procedures, which includes
  the finite-horizon estimators often used in practice. Crucially, we show that estimating
  the mean by directly sampling from the discounted kernel of the Markov process brings
  compelling statistical properties w.r.t. the alternative estimators, as it matches
  the lower bound without requiring a careful tuning of the episode horizon.
