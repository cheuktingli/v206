title: Learning from Multiple Sources for Data-to-Text and Text-to-Data
software: https://github.com/sngdng/MSUnsupVAE
abstract: 'Data-to-text (D2T) and text-to-data (T2D) are dual tasks that convert structured
  data, such as graphs or tables into fluent text, and vice versa. These tasks are
  usually handled separately and use corpora extracted from a single source. Current
  systems leverage pre-trained language models fine-tuned on D2T or T2D tasks. This
  approach has two main limitations: first, a separate system has to be tuned for
  each task and source; second, learning is limited by the scarcity of available corpora.
  This paper considers a more general scenario where data are available from multiple
  heterogeneous sources. Each source, with its specific data format and semantic domain,
  provides a non-parallel corpus of text and structured data. We introduce a variational
  auto-encoder model with disentangled style and content variables that allows us
  to represent the diversity that stems from multiple sources of text and data. Our
  model is designed to handle the tasks of D2T and T2D jointly. We evaluate our model
  on several datasets, and show that by learning from multiple sources, our model
  closes the performance gap with its supervised single-source counterpart and outperforms
  it in some cases.'
