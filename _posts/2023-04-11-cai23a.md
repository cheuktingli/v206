title: Active Cost-aware Labeling of Streaming Data
abstract: We study actively labeling streaming data, where an active learner is faced
  with a stream of data points and must carefully choose which of these points to
  label via an expensive experiment. Such problems frequently arise in applications
  such as healthcare and astronomy. We first study a setting when the data’s inputs
  belong to one of K discrete distributions and formalize this problem via a loss
  that captures the labeling cost and the prediction error. When the labeling cost
  is B, our algorithm, which chooses to label a point if the uncertainty is larger
  than a time and cost dependent threshold, achieves a worst-case upper bound of $\tilde
  O(B^{\frac{1}{3}} K^{\frac{1}{3}} T^{\frac{2}{3}})$ on the loss after T rounds.
  We also provide a more nuanced upper bound which demonstrates that the algorithm
  can adapt to the arrival pattern, and achieves better performance when the arrival
  pattern is more favorable. We complement both upper bounds with matching lower bounds.
  We next study this problem when the inputs belong to a continuous domain and the
  output of the experiment is a smooth function with bounded RKHS norm. After T rounds
  in d dimensions, we show that the loss is bounded by $\tilde O(B^{\frac{1}{d+3}}
  T^{\frac{d+2}{d+3}})$ in an RKHS with a squared exponential kernel and by $\tilde
  O(B^{\frac{1}{2d+3}} T^{\frac{2d+2}{2d+3}})$ in an RKHS with a Matérn kernel. Our
  empirical evaluation demonstrates that our method outperforms other baselines in
  several synthetic experiments and two real experiments in medicine and astronomy.
