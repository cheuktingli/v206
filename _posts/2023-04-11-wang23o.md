title: Compositional Probabilistic and Causal Inference using Tractable Circuit Models
software: https://github.com/wangben88/causal-pc
abstract: Probabilistic circuits (PCs) are a class of tractable probabilistic models,
  which admit efficient inference routines depending on their structural properties.
  In this paper, we introduce md-vtrees, a novel structural formulation of (marginal)
  determinism in structured decomposable PCs, which generalizes previously proposed
  classes such as probabilistic sentential decision diagrams. Crucially, we show how
  md-vtrees can be used to derive tractability conditions and efficient algorithms
  for advanced inference queries expressed as arbitrary compositions of basic probabilistic
  operations, such as marginalization, multiplication and reciprocals, in a sound
  and generalizable manner. In particular, we derive the first polytime algorithms
  for causal inference queries such as backdoor adjustment on PCs. As a practical
  instantiation of the framework, we propose MDNets, a novel PC architecture using
  md-vtrees, and empirically demonstrate their application to causal inference.
