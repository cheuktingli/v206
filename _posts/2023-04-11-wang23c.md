title: Toward Fairness in Text Generation via Mutual Information Minimization based
  on Importance Sampling
abstract: Pretrained language models (PLMs), such as GPT- 2, have achieved remarkable
  empirical performance in text generation tasks. However, pre- trained on large-scale
  natural language corpora, the generated text from PLMs may exhibit social bias against
  disadvantaged demographic groups. To improve the fairness of PLMs in text generation,
  we propose to minimize the mutual information between the semantics in the generated
  text sentences and their demographic polarity, i.e., the demographic group to which
  the sentence is referring. In this way, the mentioning of a demographic group (e.g.,
  male or female) is encouraged to be independent from how it is described in the
  generated text, thus effectively alleviating the so cial bias. Moreover, we propose
  to efficiently estimate the upper bound of the above mutual information via importance
  sampling, leveraging a natural language corpus. We also propose a distillation mechanism
  that preserves the language modeling ability of the PLMs after debiasing. Empirical
  results on real-world benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed method yields superior
  performance in term of both fairness and language modeling ability.
