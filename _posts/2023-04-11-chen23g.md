title: Reducing Discretization Error in the Frank-Wolfe Method
software: https://github.com/zoechen369/Reducing-Discretization-Error-in-the-Frank-Wolfe-Method
abstract: 'The Frank-Wolfe algorithm is a popular method in structurally constrained
  machine learning applications, due to its fast per-iteration complexity. However,
  one major limitation of the method is a slow rate of convergence that is difficult
  to accelerate due to erratic, zig-zagging step directions, even asymptotically close
  to the solution. We view this as an artifact of discretization; that is to say,
  the Frank-Wolfe flow, which is its trajectory at asymptotically small step sizes,
  does not zig-zag, and reducing discretization error will go hand-in-hand in producing
  a more stabilized method, with better convergence properties. We propose two improvements:
  a multistep Frank-Wolfe method that directly applies optimized higher-order discretization
  schemes; and an LMO-averaging scheme with reduced discretization error, and whose
  local convergence rate over general convex sets accelerates from a rate of $O(1/k)$
  to up to $O(1/k^{3/2})$.'
