title: Model-X Sequential Testing for Conditional Independence via Testing by Betting
software: https://github.com/shaersh/ecrt
abstract: This paper develops a model-free sequential test for conditional independence.
  The proposed test allows researchers to analyze an incoming i.i.d. data stream with
  any arbitrary dependency structure, and safely conclude whether a feature is conditionally
  associated with the response under study. We allow the processing of data points
  online, as soon as they arrive, and stop data acquisition once significant results
  are detected, rigorously controlling the type-I error rate. Our test can work with
  any sophisticated machine learning algorithm to enhance data efficiency to the extent
  possible. The developed method is inspired by two statistical frameworks. The first
  is the model-X conditional randomization test, a test for conditional independence
  that is valid in offline settings where the sample size is fixed in advance. The
  second is testing by betting, a “game-theoretic” approach for sequential hypothesis
  testing. We conduct synthetic experiments to demonstrate the advantage of our test
  over out-of-the-box sequential tests that account for the multiplicity of tests
  in the time horizon, and demonstrate the practicality of our proposal by applying
  it to real-world tasks.
