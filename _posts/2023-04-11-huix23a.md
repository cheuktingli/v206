title: Tight Regret and Complexity Bounds for Thompson Sampling via Langevin Monte
  Carlo
abstract: In this paper, we consider high dimensional contextual bandit problems.
  Within this setting, Thompson Sampling and its variants have been proposed and have
  been successfully applied to multiple machine learning problems. Existing theory
  on Thompson Sampling shows that it has suboptimal dimension dependency in contrast
  to upper confidence bound (UCB) algorithms. To circumvent this issue and obtain
  optimal regret bounds, (Zhang, 2021) recently proposed to modify Thompson Sampling
  by enforcing more exploration and hence is able to attain optimal regret bounds.
  Nonetheless, this analysis does not permit tractable implementation in high dimensions.
  The main challenge therein is the simulation of the posterior samples at each step
  given the available observations. To overcome this, we propose and analyze the use
  of Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods. As a corollary, we show that for contextual
  linear bandits, using Langevin Monte Carlo (LMC) or Metropolis Adjusted Langevin
  Algorithm (MALA), our algorithm attains optimal regret bounds of $\tilde{O}(d\sqrt{T})$.
  Furthermore, we show that this is obtained with $\tilde{O}(dT^4)$, $\tilde{O}(dT^2)$
  data evaluations respectively for LMC and MALA. Finally, we validate our findings
  through numerical simulations and show that we outperform vanilla Thompson sampling
  in high dimensions.
