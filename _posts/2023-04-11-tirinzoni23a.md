title: On the Complexity of Representation Learning in Contextual Linear Bandits
abstract: In contextual linear bandits, the reward function is assumed to be a linear
  combination of an unknown reward vector and a given embedding of context-arm pairs.
  In practice, the embedding is often learned at the same time as the reward vector,
  thus leading to an online representation learning problem. Existing approaches to
  representation learning in contextual bandits are either very generic (e.g., model-selection
  techniques or algorithms for learning with arbitrary function classes) or specialized
  to particular structures (e.g., nested features or representations with certain
  spectral properties). As a result, the understanding of the cost of representation
  learning in contextual linear bandit is still limited. In this paper, we take a
  systematic approach to the problem and provide a comprehensive study through an
  instance-dependent perspective. We show that representation learning is fundamentally
  more complex than linear bandits (i.e., learning with a given representation). In
  particular, learning with a given set of representations is never simpler than learning
  with the worst realizable representation in the set, while we show cases where it
  can be arbitrarily harder. We complement this result with an extensive discussion
  of how it relates to existing literature and we illustrate positive instances where
  representation learning is as complex as learning with a fixed representation and
  where sub-logarithmic regret is achievable.
