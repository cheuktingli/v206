title: 'USIM Gate: UpSampling Module for Segmenting Precise Boundaries concerning
  Entropy'
software: https://github.com/kyungsu-lee-ksl/USIM-GATE
abstract: 'Deep learning (DL) techniques for precise semantic segmentation have remained
  a challenge because of the vague boundaries of target objects caused by the low
  resolution of images. Despite the improved segmentation performance using up/downsampling
  operations in early DL models, conventional operators cannot fully preserve spatial
  information and thus generate vague boundaries of target objects. Therefore, for
  the precise segmentation of target objects in many domains, this paper presents
  two novel operators: (1) upsampling interpolation method (USIM), an operator that
  upsamples input feature maps and combines feature maps into one while preserving
  the spatial information of both inputs, and (2) USIM gate (UG), an advanced USIM
  operator with boundary-attention mechanisms. We designed our experiments using aerial
  images where the boundaries critically influence the results. Furthermore, we verified
  the feasibility that our approach effectively segments target objects using the
  cityscapes dataset. The experimental results demonstrate that using the USIM and
  UG with state-of-the-art DL models can improve the segmentation performance with
  clear boundaries of target objects (Intersection over Union: +6.9$%$; BJ: +10.1$%$).
  Furthermore, mathematical proofs verify that the USIM and UG contribute to the handling
  of spatial information.'
