title: Provably Efficient Reinforcement Learning via Surprise Bound
abstract: Value function approximation is important in modern reinforcement learning
  (RL) problems especially when the state space is (infinitely) large. Despite the
  importance and wide applicability of value function approximation, its theoretical
  understanding is still not as sophisticated as its empirical success, especially
  in the context of general function approximation. In this paper, we propose a provably
  efficient RL algorithm (both computationally and statistically) with general value
  function approximations. We show that if the value functions can be approximated
  by a function class $\mathcal{F}$ which satisfies the bellman-completeness assumption,
  our algorithm achieves an $\widetilde{O}(\mathrm{poly}(\iota H)\sqrt{T})$ regret
  bound where $\iota$ is the product of the surprise bound and log-covering numbers,
  $H$ is the planning horizon, $K$ is the number of episodes and $T = HK$ is the total
  number of steps the agent interacts with the environment. Our algorithm achieves
  reasonable regret bounds when applied to both the linear setting and the sparse
  high-dimensional linear setting. Moreover, our algorithm only needs to solve $O(H\log
  K)$ empirical risk minimization (ERM) problems, which is far more efficient than
  previous algorithms that need to solve ERM problems for $\Omega(HK)$ times.
