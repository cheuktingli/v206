title: Improved Sample Complexity Bounds for Distributionally Robust Reinforcement
  Learning
software: https://github.com/zaiyan-x/RPVL
abstract: 'We consider the problem of learning a control policy that is robust against
  the parameter mismatches between the training environment and testing environment.
  We formulate this as a distributionally robust reinforcement learning (DR-RL) problem
  where the objective is to learn the policy which maximizes the value function against
  the worst possible stochastic model of the environment in an uncertainty set. We
  focus on the tabular episodic learning setting where the algorithm has access to
  a generative model of the nominal (training) environment around which the uncertainty
  set is defined. We propose the Robust Phased Value Learning (RPVL) algorithm to
  solve this problem for the uncertainty sets specified by four different divergences:
  total variation, chi-square, Kullback-Leibler, and Wasserstein. We show that our
  algorithm achieves $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(|\mathcal{S}||\mathcal{A}| H^{5})$ sample
  complexity, which is uniformly better than the existing results by a factor of $|\mathcal{S}|$,
  where $|\mathcal{S}|$ is number of states, $|\mathcal{A}|$ is the number of actions,
  and $H$ is the horizon length. We also provide the first-ever sample complexity
  result for the Wasserstein uncertainty set. Finally, we demonstrate the performance
  of our algorithm using simulation experiments.'
