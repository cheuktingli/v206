title: 'Mediated Uncoupled Learning and Validation with Bregman Divergences: Loss
  Family with Maximal Generality'
software: https://github.com/i-yamane/mediated_uncoupled_learning
abstract: In mediated uncoupled learning (MU-learning), the goal is to predict an
  output variable $Y$ given an input variable $X$ as in ordinary supervised learning
  while the training dataset has no joint samples of $(X, Y)$ but only independent
  samples of $(X, U)$ and $(U, Y)$ each observed with a mediating variable $U$. The
  existing MU-learning methods can only handle the squared loss, which prohibited
  the use of other popular loss functions such as the cross-entropy loss. We propose
  a general MU-learning framework that allows for the problems with Bregman divergences,
  which cover a wide range of loss functions useful for various types of tasks, in
  a unified manner. This loss family has maximal generality among those whose minimizers
  characterize the conditional expectation. We prove that the proposed objective function
  is a tighter approximation to the oracle loss that one would minimize if ordinary
  supervised samples of $(X, Y)$ were available. We also propose an estimator of an
  interval containing the expected test loss of predictions of a trained model only
  using $(X, U)$- and $(U, Y)$-data. We provide a theoretical analysis on the excess
  risk for the proposed method and confirm its practical usefulness with regression
  experiments with synthetic data and low-quality image classification experiments
  with benchmark datasets.
