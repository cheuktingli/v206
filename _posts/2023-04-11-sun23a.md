title: A New Causal Decomposition Paradigm towards Health Equity
abstract: Causal decomposition has provided a powerful tool to analyze health disparity
  problems by assessing the proportion of disparity caused by each mediator (the variable
  that mediates the effect of the exposure on the health outcome). However, most of
  these methods lack policy implications, as they fail to account for all sources
  of disparities caused by the mediator. Besides, its identifiability needs to specify
  a set to be admissible to make the strong ignorability condition hold, which can
  be problematic as some variables in this set may induce new spurious features. To
  resolve these issues, under the framework of the structural causal model, we propose
  a new decomposition, dubbed as adjusted and unadjusted effects, which is able to
  include all types of disparity by adjusting each mediatorâ€™s distribution from the
  disadvantaged group to the advantaged ones. Besides, by learning the maximal ancestral
  graph and implementing causal discovery from heterogeneous data, we can identify
  the admissible set, followed by an efficient algorithm for estimation. The theoretical
  correctness and efficacy of our method are demonstrated using a synthetic dataset
  and a common spine disease dataset.
