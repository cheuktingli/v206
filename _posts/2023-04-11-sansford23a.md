title: Implications of sparsity and high triangle density for graph representation
  learning
software: https://github.com/hsansford1/triangle_density
abstract: Recent work has shown that sparse graphs containing many triangles cannot
  be reproduced using a finite-dimensional representation of the nodes, in which link
  probabilities are inner products. Here, we show that such graphs can be reproduced
  using an infinite-dimensional inner product model, where the node representations
  lie on a low-dimensional manifold. Recovering a global representation of the manifold
  is impossible in a sparse regime. However, we can zoom in on local neighbourhoods,
  where a lower-dimensional representation is possible. As our constructions allow
  the points to be uniformly distributed on the manifold, we find evidence against
  the common perception that triangles imply community structure.
