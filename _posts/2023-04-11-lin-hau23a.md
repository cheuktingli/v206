title: Entropic Risk Optimization in Discounted MDPs
software: https://github.com/marekpetrik/2023-AISTATS-ERM
abstract: Risk-averse Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) have optimal policies that
  achieve high returns with low variability, but these MDPs are often difficult to
  solve. Only a few practical risk-averse objectives admit a dynamic programming (DP)
  formulation, which is the mainstay of most MDP and RL algorithms. We derive a new
  DP formulation for discounted risk-averse MDPs with Entropic Risk Measure (ERM)
  and Entropic Value at Risk (EVaR) objectives. Our DP formulation for ERM, which
  is possible because of our novel definition of value function with time-dependent
  risk levels, can approximate optimal policies in a time that is polynomial in the
  approximation error. We then use the ERM algorithm to optimize the EVaR objective
  in polynomial time using an optimized discretization scheme. Our numerical results
  show the viability of our formulations and algorithms in discounted MDPs.
