title: Dropout-Resilient Secure Multi-Party Collaborative Learning with Linear Communication
  Complexity
software: https://github.com/XingyuLu2/PICO.git
abstract: Collaborative machine learning enables privacy-preserving training of machine
  learning models without collecting sensitive client data. Despite recent breakthroughs,
  communication bottleneck is still a major challenge against its scalability to larger
  networks. To address this challenge, we propose PICO, the first collaborative learning
  framework with linear communication complexity, significantly improving over the
  quadratic state-of-the-art, under formal information-theoretic privacy guarantees.
  Theoretical analysis demonstrates that PICO slashes the communication cost while
  achieving equal computational complexity, adversary resilience, robustness to client
  dropouts, and model accuracy to the state-of-the-art. Extensive experiments demonstrate
  up to 91x reduction in the communication overhead, and up to 7x speed-up in the
  wall-clock training time compared to the state-of-the-art. As such, PICO addresses
  a key technical challenge in multi-party collaborative learning, paving the way
  for future large-scale privacy-preserving learning frameworks.
