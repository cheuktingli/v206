title: Improving Dual-Encoder Training through Dynamic Indexes for Negative Mining
software: https://github.com/nmonath/graphgrove
abstract: Dual encoder models are ubiquitous in modern classification and retrieval.
  Crucial for training such dual encoders is an accurate estimation of gradients from
  the partition function of the softmax over the large output space; this requires
  finding negative targets that contribute most significantly (â€˜hard negatives). Since
  dual encoder model parameters change during training, the use of traditional static
  nearest neighbor indexes can be sub-optimal. These static indexes (1) periodically
  require expensive re-building of the index, which in turn requires (2) expensive
  re-encoding of all targets using updated model parameters. This paper addresses
  both of these challenges. First, we introduce an algorithm that uses a tree structure
  to approximate the softmax with provable bounds and that dynamically maintains the
  tree. Second, we approximate the effect of a gradient update on target encodings
  with an efficient Nystrom low-rank approximation. In our empirical study on datasets
  with over twenty million targets, our approach cuts error by half in relation to
  oracle brute-force negative mining. Furthermore, our method surpasses prior state-of-the-art
  while using 150x less accelerator memory.
