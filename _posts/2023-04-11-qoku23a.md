title: 'Encoding Domain Knowledge in Multi-view Latent Variable Models: A Bayesian
  Approach with Structured Sparsity'
software: https://github.com/MLO-lab/MuVI
abstract: Many real-world systems are described not only by data from a single source
  but via multiple data views. In genomic medicine, for instance, patients can be
  characterized by data from different molecular layers. Latent variable models with
  structured sparsity are a commonly used tool for disentangling variation within
  and across data views. However, their interpretability is cumbersome since it requires
  a direct inspection and interpretation of each factor from domain experts. Here,
  we propose MuVI, a novel multi-view latent variable model based on a modified horseshoe
  prior for modeling structured sparsity. This facilitates the incorporation of limited
  and noisy domain knowledge, thereby allowing for an analysis of multi-view data
  in an inherently explainable manner. We demonstrate that our model (i) outperforms
  state-of-the-art approaches for modeling structured sparsity in terms of the reconstruction
  error and the precision/recall, (ii) robustly integrates noisy domain expertise
  in the form of feature sets, (iii) promotes the identifiability of factors and (iv)
  infers interpretable and biologically meaningful axes of variation in a real-world
  multi-view dataset of cancer patients.
