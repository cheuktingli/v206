title: Bayesian Optimization with Conformal Prediction Sets
software: https://github.com/samuelstanton/conformal-bayesopt
abstract: 'Bayesian optimization is a coherent, ubiquitous approach to decision-making
  under uncertainty, with applications including multi-arm bandits, active learning,
  and black-box optimization. Bayesian optimization selects decisions (i.e. objective
  function queries) with maximal expected utility with respect to the posterior distribution
  of a Bayesian model, which quantifies reducible, epistemic uncertainty about query
  outcomes. In practice, subjectively implausible outcomes can occur regularly for
  two reasons: 1) model misspecification and 2) covariate shift. Conformal prediction
  is an uncertainty quantification method with coverage guarantees even for misspecified
  models and a simple mechanism to correct for covariate shift. We propose conformal
  Bayesian optimization, which directs queries towards regions of search space where
  the model predictions have guaranteed validity, and investigate its behavior on
  a suite of black-box optimization tasks and tabular ranking tasks. In many cases
  we find that query coverage can be significantly improved without harming sample-efficiency.'
