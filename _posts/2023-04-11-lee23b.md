title: Exact Gradient Computation for Spiking Neural Networks via Forward Propagation
software: https://github.com/janehjlee/exact_snn_forward_prop
abstract: Spiking neural networks (SNN) have recently emerged as alternatives to traditional
  neural networks, owing to its energy efficiency benefits and capacity to capture
  biological neuronal mechanisms. However, the classic backpropagation algorithm for
  training traditional networks has been notoriously difficult to apply to SNN due
  to the hard-thresholding and discontinuities at spike times. Therefore, a large
  majority of prior work believes exact gradients for SNN w.r.t. their weights do
  not exist and has focused on approximation methods to produce surrogate gradients.
  In this paper, (1) by applying the implicit function theorem to SNN at the discrete
  spike times, we prove that, albeit being non-differentiable in time, SNNs have well-defined
  gradients w.r.t. their weights, and (2) we propose a novel training algorithm, called
  forward propagation (FP), that computes exact gradients for SNN. FP exploits the
  causality structure between the spikes and allows us to parallelize computation
  forward in time. It can be used with other algorithms that simulate the forward
  pass, and it also provides insights on why other related algorithms such as Hebbian
  learning and also recently-proposed surrogate gradient methods may perform well.
