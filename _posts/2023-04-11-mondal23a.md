title: Minority Oversampling for Imbalanced Data via Class-Preserving Regularized
  Auto-Encoders
software: https://github.com/arnabkmondal/OversamplingRAE
abstract: 'Class imbalance is a common phenomenon in multiple application domains
  such as healthcare, where the sample occurrence of one or few class categories is
  more prevalent in the dataset than the rest. This work addresses the class-imbalance
  issue by proposing an over-sampling method for the minority classes in the latent
  space of a Regularized Auto-Encoder (RAE). Specifically, we construct a latent space
  by maximizing the conditional data likelihood using an Encoder-Decoder structure,
  such that oversampling through convex combinations of latent samples preserves the
  class identity. A jointly-trained linear classifier that separates convexly coupled
  latent vectors from different classes is used to impose this property on the AEâ€™s
  latent space. Further, the aforesaid linear classifier is used for final classification
  without retraining. We theoretically show that our method can achieve a low variance
  risk estimate compared to naive oversampling methods and is robust to overfitting.
  We conduct several experiments on benchmark datasets and show that our method outperforms
  the existing oversampling techniques for handling class imbalance. The code of the
  proposed method is available at: https://github.com/arnabkmondal/oversamplingrae.'
