title: Scalable Unbalanced Sobolev Transport for Measures on a Graph
software: https://github.com/lttam/UnbalancedSobolevTransport
abstract: 'Optimal transport (OT) is a popular and powerful tool for comparing probability
  measures. However, OT suffers a few drawbacks: (i) input measures required to have
  the same mass, (ii) a high computational complexity, and (iii) indefiniteness which
  limits its applications on kernel-dependent algorithmic approaches. To tackle issues
  (ii)–(iii), Le et al. (2022) recently proposed Sobolev transport for measures on
  a graph having the same total mass by leveraging the graph structure over supports.
  In this work, we consider measures that may have different total mass and are supported
  on a graph metric space. To alleviate the disadvantages (i)–(iii) of OT, we propose
  a novel and scalable approach to extend Sobolev transport for this unbalanced setting
  where measures may have different total mass. We show that the proposed unbalanced
  Sobolev transport (UST) admits a closed-form formula for fast computation, and it
  is also negative definite. Additionally, we derive geometric structures for the
  UST and establish relations between our UST and other transport distances. We further
  exploit the negative definiteness to design positive definite kernels and evaluate
  them on various simulations to illustrate their fast computation and comparable
  performances against other transport baselines for unbalanced measures on a graph.'
