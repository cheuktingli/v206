title: 'FAIR: Fair Collaborative Active Learning with Individual Rationality for Scientific
  Discovery'
software: https://github.com/XinyiYS/FAIR
abstract: Scientific discovery aims to find new patterns and test specific hypotheses
  by analysing large-scale experimental data. However, various practical limitations
  (e.g., high experimental costs or the inability to perform some experiments) make
  it challenging for researchers to collect sufficient experimental data for successful
  scientific discovery. To this end, we propose a collaborative active learning (CAL)
  framework that enables researchers to share their experimental data for mutual benefit.
  Specifically, our proposed coordinated acquisition function sets out to achieve
  individual rationality and fairness so that everyone can equitably benefit from
  collaboration. We empirically demonstrate that our method outperforms existing batch
  active learning ones (adapted to the CAL setting) in terms of both learning performance
  and fairness on various real-world scientific discovery datasets (biochemistry,
  material science, and physics).
