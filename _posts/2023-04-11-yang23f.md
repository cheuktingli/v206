title: Distributionally Robust Policy Gradient for Offline Contextual Bandits
software: https://github.com/guoyihonggyh/Distributionally-Robust-Policy-Gradient-for-Offline-Contextual-Bandits
abstract: Learning an optimal policy from offline data is notoriously challenging,
  which requires the evaluation of the learning policy using data pre-collected from
  a static logging policy. We study the policy optimization problem in offline contextual
  bandits using policy gradient methods. We employ a distributionally robust policy
  gradient method, DROPO, to account for the distributional shift between the static
  logging policy and the learning policy in policy gradient. Our approach conservatively
  estimates the conditional reward distributional and updates the policy accordingly.
  We show that our algorithm converges to a stationary point with rate $O(1/T)$, where
  $T$ is the number of time steps. We conduct experiments on real-world datasets under
  various scenarios of logging policies to compare our proposed algorithm with baseline
  methods in offline contextual bandits. We also propose a variant of our algorithm,
  DROPO-exp, to further improve the performance when a limited amount of online interaction
  is allowed. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed
  algorithms, especially under heavily biased offline data.
