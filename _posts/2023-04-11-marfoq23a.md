title: Federated Learning for Data Streams
software: https://github.com/omarfoq/streaming-fl
abstract: Federated learning (FL) is an effective solution to train machine learning
  models on the increasing amount of data generated by IoT devices and smartphones
  while keeping such data localized. Most previous work on federated learning assumes
  that clients operate on static datasets collected before training starts. This approach
  may be inefficient because 1) it ignores new samples clients collect during training,
  and 2) it may require a potentially long preparatory phase for clients to collect
  enough data. Moreover, learning on static datasets may be simply impossible in scenarios
  with small aggregate storage across devices. It is, therefore, necessary to design
  federated algorithms able to learn from data streams. In this work, we formulate
  and study the problem of federated learning for data streams. We propose a general
  FL algorithm to learn from data streams through an opportune weighted empirical
  risk minimization. Our theoretical analysis provides insights to configure such
  an algorithm, and we evaluate its performance on a wide range of machine learning
  tasks.
