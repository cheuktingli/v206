title: Direct Inference of Effect of Treatment (DIET) for a Cookieless World
software: https://github.com/sshivs/DIET
abstract: Brands use cookies and device identifiers to link different web visits to
  the same consumer. However, with increasing demands for privacy, these identifiers
  are about to be phased out, making identity fragmentation a permanent feature of
  the online world. Assessing treatment effects via randomized experiments (A/B testing)
  in such a scenario is challenging because identity fragmentation causes a) users
  to receive hybrid/mixed treatments, and b) hides the causal link between the historical
  treatments and the outcome. In this work, we address the problem of estimating treatment
  effects when a lack of identification leads to incomplete knowledge of historical
  treatments. This is a challenging problem which has not been addressed in literature
  yet. We develop a new method called DIET, which can adjust for users being exposed
  to mixed treatments without the entire history of treatments being available. Our
  method takes inspiration from the Cox model, and uses a proportional outcome approach
  under which we prove that one can obtain consistent estimates of treatment effects
  even under identity fragmentation. Our experiments, on one simulated and two real
  datasets, show that our method leads to up to 20% reduction in error and 25% reduction
  in bias over the naive estimate.
