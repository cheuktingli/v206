title: Equivariant Representation Learning via Class-Pose Decomposition
software: https://github.com/equivariant-ml/equivariant-representation-learning
abstract: We introduce a general method for learning representations that are equivariant
  to symmetries of data. Our central idea is to decompose the latent space into an
  invariant factor and the symmetry group itself. The components semantically correspond
  to intrinsic data classes and poses respectively. The learner is trained on a loss
  encouraging equivariance based on supervision from relative symmetry information.
  The approach is motivated by theoretical results from group theory and guarantees
  representations that are lossless, interpretable and disentangled. We provide an
  empirical investigation via experiments involving datasets with a variety of symmetries.
  Results show that our representations capture the geometry of data and outperform
  other equivariant representation learning frameworks.
