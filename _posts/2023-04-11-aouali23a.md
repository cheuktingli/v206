title: Mixed-Effect Thompson Sampling
software: https://github.com/imadaouali/Mixed-Effect-Thompson-Sampling
abstract: A contextual bandit is a popular framework for online learning to act under
  uncertainty. In practice, the number of actions is huge and their expected rewards
  are correlated. In this work, we introduce a general framework for capturing such
  correlations through a mixed-effect model where actions are related through multiple
  shared effect parameters. To explore efficiently using this structure, we propose
  Mixed-Effect Thompson Sampling (meTS) and bound its Bayes regret. The regret bound
  has two terms, one for learning the action parameters and the other for learning
  the shared effect parameters. The terms reflect the structure of our model and the
  quality of priors. Our theoretical findings are validated empirically using both
  synthetic and real-world problems. We also propose numerous extensions of practical
  interest. While they do not come with guarantees, they perform well empirically
  and show the generality of the proposed framework.
