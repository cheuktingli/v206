title: Robust Linear Regression for General Feature Distribution
software: https://git.sr.ht/~generaltom/msc_research
abstract: 'We investigate robust linear regression where data may be contaminated
  by an oblivious adversary, i.e., an adversary that knows the data distribution but
  is otherwise oblivious to the realization of the data samples. This model has been
  previously analyzed under strong assumptions. Concretely, (i) all previous works
  assume that the covariance matrix of the features is positive definite; (ii) most
  of them assume that the features are centered. Additionally, all previous works
  make additional restrictive assumptions, e.g., assuming Gaussianity of the features
  or symmetric distribution of the corruptions. In this work, we investigate robust
  regression under a more general set of assumptions: (i) the covariance matrix may
  be either positive definite or positive semi definite, (ii) features may not be
  centered, (iii) no assumptions beyond boundedness (or sub-Gaussianity) of the features
  and the measurement noise. Under these assumptions we analyze a sequential algorithm,
  namely, a natural SGD variant for this problem, and show that it enjoys a fast convergence
  rate when the covariance matrix is positive definite. In the positive semi definite
  case we show that there are two regimes: if the features are centered, we can obtain
  a standard convergence rate; Otherwise, the adversary can cause any learner to fail
  arbitrarily.'
