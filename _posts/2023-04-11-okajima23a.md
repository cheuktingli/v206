title: Average case analysis of Lasso under ultra sparse conditions
abstract: We analyze the performance of the least absolute shrinkage and selection
  operator (Lasso) for the linear model when the number of regressors $N$ grows larger
  keeping the true support size $d$ finite, i.e., the ultra-sparse case. The result
  is based on a novel treatment of the non-rigorous replica method in statistical
  physics, which has been applied only to problem settings where $N$, $d$ and the
  number of observations $M$ tend to infinity at the same rate. Our analysis makes
  it possible to assess the average performance of Lasso with Gaussian sensing matrices
  without assumptions on the scaling of $N$ and $M$, the noise distribution, and the
  profile of the true signal. Under mild conditions on the noise distribution, the
  analysis also offers a lower bound on the sample complexity necessary for partial
  and perfect support recovery when $M$ diverges as $M = O(\log N)$. The obtained
  bound for perfect support recovery is a generalization of that given in previous
  literature, which only considers the case of Gaussian noise and diverging $d$. Extensive
  numerical experiments strongly support our analysis.
