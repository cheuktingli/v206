title: 'Connectivity-contrastive learning: Combining causal discovery and representation
  learning for multimodal data'
software: https://github.com/hmorioka/CCL
abstract: Causal discovery methods typically extract causal relations between multiple
  nodes (variables) based on univariate observations of each node. However, one frequently
  encounters situations where each node is multivariate, i.e. has multiple observational
  modalities. Furthermore, the observed modalities may be generated through an unknown
  mixing process, so that some original latent variables are entangled inside the
  nodes. In such a multimodal case, the existing frameworks cannot be applied. To
  analyze such data, we propose a new causal representation learning framework called
  connectivity-contrastive learning (CCL). CCL disentangles the observational mixing
  and extracts a set of mutually independent latent components, each having a separate
  causal structure between the nodes. The actual learning proceeds by a novel self-supervised
  learning method in which the pretext task is to predict the label of a pair of nodes
  from the observations of the node pairs. We present theorems which show that CCL
  can indeed identify both the latent components and the multimodal causal structure
  under weak technical assumptions, up to some indeterminacy. Finally, we experimentally
  show its superior causal discovery performance compared to state-of-the-art baselines,
  in particular demonstrating robustness against latent confounders.
