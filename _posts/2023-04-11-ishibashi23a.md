title: A stopping criterion for Bayesian optimization by the gap of expected minimum
  simple regrets
abstract: Bayesian optimization (BO) improves the efficiency of black-box optimization;
  however, the associated computational cost and power consumption remain dominant
  in the application of machine learning methods. This paper proposes a method of
  determining the stopping time in BO. The proposed criterion is based on the difference
  between the expectation of the minimum of a variant of the simple regrets before
  and after evaluating the objective function with a new parameter setting. Unlike
  existing stopping criteria, the proposed criterion is guaranteed to converge to
  the theoretically optimal stopping criterion for any choices of arbitrary acquisition
  functions and threshold values. Moreover, the threshold for the stopping criterion
  can be determined automatically and adaptively. We experimentally demonstrate that
  the proposed stopping criterion finds reasonable timing to stop a BO with a small
  number of evaluations of the objective function.
