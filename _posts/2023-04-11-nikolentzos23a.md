title: 'Weisfeiler and Leman go Hyperbolic: Learning Distance Preserving Node Representations'
software: https://github.com/MichailChatzianastasis/WLHN
abstract: In recent years, graph neural networks (GNNs) have emerged as a promising
  tool for solving machine learning problems on graphs. Most GNNs are members of the
  family of message passing neural networks (MPNNs). There is a close connection between
  these models and the Weisfeiler-Leman (WL) test of isomorphism, an algorithm that
  can successfully test isomorphism for a broad class of graphs. Recently, much research
  has focused on measuring the expressive power of GNNs. For instance, it has been
  shown that standard MPNNs are at most as powerful as WL in terms of distinguishing
  non-isomorphic graphs. However, these studies have largely ignored the distances
  between the representations of the nodes/graphs which are of paramount importance
  for learning tasks. In this paper, we define a distance function between nodes which
  is based on the hierarchy produced by the WL algorithm, and propose a model that
  learns representations which preserve those distances between nodes. Since the emerging
  hierarchy corresponds to a tree, to learn these representations, we capitalize on
  recent advances in the field of hyperbolic neural networks. We empirically evaluate
  the proposed model on standard graph and node classification datasets where it achieves
  competitive performance with state-of-the-art models.
