title: On the Limitations of the Elo, Real-World Games are Transitive, not Additive
software: https://github.com/QB3/discrating
abstract: 'The Elo score has been extensively used to rank players by their skill
  or strength in competitive games such as chess, go, or StarCraft II. The Elo score
  implicitly assumes games have a strong additive—hence transitive—component. In this
  paper, we investigate the challenge of identifying transitive components in games.
  As a starting point, we show that the Elo score provably fails to extract the transitive
  component of some elementary transitive games. Based on this observation, we propose
  an alternative ranking system which properly extracts the transitive components
  in these games. Finally, we conduct an in-depth empirical validation on real-world
  game payoff matrices: it shows significant prediction performance improvements compared
  to the Elo score.'
