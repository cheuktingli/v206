title: Sample Efficiency of Data Augmentation Consistency Regularization
abstract: Data augmentation is popular in the training of large neural networks; however,
  currently, theoretical understanding of the discrepancy between different algorithmic
  choices of leveraging augmented data remains limited. In this paper, we take a step
  in this direction â€“ we first present a simple and novel analysis for linear regression
  with label invariant augmentations, demonstrating that data augmentation consistency
  (DAC) is intrinsically more efficient than empirical risk minimization on augmented
  data (DA-ERM). The analysis is then generalized to misspecified augmentations (i.e.,
  augmentations that change the labels), which again demonstrates the merit of DAC
  over DA-ERM. Further, we extend our analysis to non-linear models (e.g., neural
  networks) and present generalization bounds. Finally, we perform experiments that
  make a clean and apples-to-apples comparison (i.e., with no extra modeling or data
  tweaks) between DAC and DA-ERM using CIFAR-100 and WideResNet; these together demonstrate
  the superior efficacy of DAC.
