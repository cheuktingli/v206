title: 'Ultra-marginal Feature Importance: Learning from Data with Causal Guarantees'
software: https://github.com/HydroML/UMFI
abstract: Scientists frequently prioritize learning from data rather than training
  the best possible model; however, research in machine learning often prioritizes
  the latter. Marginal contribution feature importance (MCI) was developed to break
  this trend by providing a useful framework for quantifying the relationships in
  data. In this work, we aim to improve upon the theoretical properties, performance,
  and runtime of MCI by introducing ultra-marginal feature importance (UMFI), which
  uses dependence removal techniques from the AI fairness literature as its foundation.
  We first propose axioms for feature importance methods that seek to explain the
  causal and associative relationships in data, and we prove that UMFI satisfies these
  axioms under basic assumptions. We then show on real and simulated data that UMFI
  performs better than MCI, especially in the presence of correlated interactions
  and unrelated features, while partially learning the structure of the causal graph
  and reducing the exponential runtime of MCI to super-linear.
