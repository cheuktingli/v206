title: 'qEUBO: A Decision-Theoretic Acquisition Function for Preferential Bayesian
  Optimization'
software: https://github.com/RaulAstudillo06/qEUBO
abstract: Preferential Bayesian optimization (PBO) is a framework for optimizing a
  decision maker’s latent utility function using preference feedback. This work introduces
  the expected utility of the best option (qEUBO) as a novel acquisition function
  for PBO. When the decision maker’s responses are noise-free, we show that qEUBO
  is one-step Bayes optimal and thus equivalent to the popular knowledge gradient
  acquisition function. We also show that qEUBO enjoys an additive constant approximation
  guarantee to the one-step Bayes-optimal policy when the decision maker’s responses
  are corrupted by noise. We provide an extensive evaluation of qEUBO and demonstrate
  that it outperforms the state-of-the-art acquisition functions for PBO across many
  settings. Finally, we show that, under sufficient regularity conditions, qEUBO’s
  Bayesian simple regret converges to zero at a rate $o(1/n)$ as the number of queries,
  $n$, goes to infinity. In contrast, we show that simple regret under qEI, a popular
  acquisition function for standard BO often used for PBO, can fail to converge to
  zero. Enjoying superior performance, simple computation, and a grounded decision-theoretic
  justification, qEUBO is a promising acquisition function for PBO.
