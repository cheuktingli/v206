title: 'Beyond Performative Prediction: Open-environment Learning with Presence of
  Corruptions'
abstract: Performative prediction is a framework to capture the endogenous distribution
  changes resulting from the reactions of deployed environments to the learnerâ€™s decision.
  Existing results require that the collected data are sampled from the clean observed
  distribution. However, this is often not the case in real-world applications, and
  even worse, data collected in open environments may include corruption due to various
  undesirable factors. In this paper, we study the entanglement of endogenous distribution
  change and corruption in open environments, where data are obtained from a corrupted
  decision-dependent distribution. The central challenge in this problem is the entangling
  effects between changing distributions and corruptions, which impede the use of
  effective gradient-based updates. To overcome this difficulty, we propose a novel
  recursive formula that decouples the two sources of effects, which allows us to
  further exploit suitable techniques for handling two decoupled effects and obtaining
  favorable guarantees. Theoretically, we prove that our proposed algorithm converges
  to the desired solution under corrupted observations, and simultaneously it can
  retain a competitive rate in the uncorrupted case. Experimental results also support
  our theoretical findings.
