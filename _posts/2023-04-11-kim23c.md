title: Covariate-informed Representation Learning to Prevent Posterior Collapse of
  iVAE
software: https://github.com/kyg0910/CI-iVAE
abstract: The recently proposed identifiable variational autoencoder (iVAE) framework
  provides a promising approach for learning latent independent components (ICs).
  iVAEs use auxiliary covariates to build an identifiable generation structure from
  covariates to ICs to observations, and the posterior network approximates ICs given
  observations and covariates. Though the identifiability is appealing, we show that
  iVAEs could have local minimum solution where observations and the approximated
  ICs are independent given covariates.â€“ a phenomenon we referred to as the posterior
  collapse problem of iVAEs. To overcome this problem, we develop a new approach,
  covariate-informed iVAE (CI-iVAE) by considering a mixture of encoder and posterior
  distributions in the objective function. In doing so, the objective function prevents
  the posterior collapse, resulting latent representations that contain more information
  of the observations. Furthermore, CI-iVAE extends the original iVAE objective function
  to a larger class and finds the optimal one among them, thus having tighter evidence
  lower bounds than the original iVAE. Experiments on simulation datasets, EMNIST,
  Fashion-MNIST, and a large-scale brain imaging dataset demonstrate the effectiveness
  of our new method.
