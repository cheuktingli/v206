title: Adversarial robustness of VAEs through the lens of local geometry
abstract: In an unsupervised attack on variational autoencoders (VAEs), an adversary
  finds a small perturbation in an input sample that significantly changes its latent
  space encoding, thereby compromising the reconstruction for a fixed decoder. A known
  reason for such vulnerability is the distortions in the latent space resulting from
  a mismatch between approximated latent posterior and a prior distribution. Consequently,
  a slight change in an input sample can move its encoding to a low/zero density region
  in the latent space resulting in an unconstrained generation. This paper demonstrates
  that an optimal way for an adversary to attack VAEs is to exploit a directional
  bias of a stochastic pullback metric tensor induced by the encoder and decoder networks.
  The pullback metric tensor of an encoder measures the change in infinitesimal latent
  volume from an input to a latent space. Thus, it can be viewed as a lens to analyse
  the effect of input perturbations leading to latent space distortions. We propose
  robustness evaluation scores using the eigenspectrum of a pullback metric tensor.
  Moreover, we empirically show that the scores correlate with the robustness parameter
  $\beta$ of the $\beta-$VAE. Since increasing $\beta$ also degrades reconstruction
  quality, we demonstrate a simple alternative using mixup training to fill the empty
  regions in the latent space, thus improving robustness with improved reconstruction.
