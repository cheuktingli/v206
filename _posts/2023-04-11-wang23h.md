title: Scalable Spectral Clustering with Group Fairness Constraints
software: https://github.com/jiiwang/scalable_fair_spectral_clustering
abstract: There are synergies of research interests and industrial efforts in modeling
  fairness and correcting algorithmic bias in machine learning. In this paper, we
  present a scalable algorithm for spectral clustering (SC) with group fairness constraints.
  Group fairness is also known as statistical parity where in each cluster, each protected
  group is represented with the same proportion as in the entirety. While FairSC algorithm
  (Kleindessner et al., 2019) is able to find the fairer clustering, it is compromised
  by high computational costs due to the algorithm deflation such that the resulting
  algorithm, called s-FairSC, only involves the sparse matrix-vector products and
  is able to fully exploit the sparsity of the fair SC model. The experimental results
  on the modified stochastic block model demonstrate that while it is comparable with
  FairSC in recovering fair clustering, s-FairSC is 12$\times$ faster than FairSC
  for moderate model sizes. s-FairSC is further demonstrated to be scalable in the
  sense that the computational costs of s-FairSC only increase marginally compared
  to the SC without fairness constraints.
