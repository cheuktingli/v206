title: Density Ratio Estimation and Neyman Pearson Classification with Missing Data
software: https://github.com/joshgivens/DensityRatioEstimationandNeymanPersonClassificationwithMissingData
abstract: Density Ratio Estimation (DRE) is an important machine learning technique
  with many downstream applications. We consider the challenge of DRE with missing
  not at random (MNAR) data. In this setting, we show that using standard DRE methods
  leads to biased results while our proposal (M-KLIEP), an adaptation of the popular
  DRE procedure KLIEP, restores consistency. Moreover, we provide finite sample estimation
  error bounds for M-KLIEP, which demonstrate minimax optimality with respect to both
  sample size and worst-case missingness. We then adapt an important downstream application
  of DRE, Neyman-Pearson (NP) classification, to this MNAR setting. Our procedure
  both controls Type I error and achieves high power, with high probability. Finally,
  we demonstrate promising empirical performance both synthetic data and real-world
  data with simulated missingness.
