title: Structure of Nonlinear Node Embeddings in Stochastic Block Models
abstract: Nonlinear node embedding techniques such as DeepWalk and Node2Vec are used
  extensively in practice to uncover structure in graphs. Despite theoretical guarantees
  in special regimes (such as the case of high embedding dimension), the structure
  of the optimal low dimensional embeddings has not been formally understood even
  for graphs obtained from simple generative models. We consider the stochastic block
  model and show that under appropriate separation conditions, the optimal embeddings
  can be analytically characterized. Akin to known results on eigenvector based (spectral)
  embeddings, we prove theoretically that solution vectors are well-clustered, up
  to a sublinear error.
