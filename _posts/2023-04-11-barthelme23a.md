title: A Faster Sampler for Discrete Determinantal Point Processes
software: https://github.com/dahtah/DPP.jl/tree/main/misc/sampling_paper
abstract: Discrete Determinantal Point Processes (DPPs) have a wide array of potential
  applications for subsampling datasets. They are however held back in some cases
  by the high cost of sampling. In the worst-case scenario, the sampling cost scales
  as $O(n^3)$ where n is the number of elements of the ground set. A popular workaround
  to this prohibitive cost is to sample DPPs defined by low-rank kernels. In such
  cases, the cost of standard sampling algorithms scales as $O(np^2 + nm^2)$ where
  m is the (average) number of samples of the DPP (usually m $\ll$ n) and p the rank
  of the kernel used to define the DPP (m $\leq$ p $\leq$ n). The first term, $O(np^2)$,
  comes from a SVD-like step. We focus here on the second term of this cost, $O(nm^2)$,
  and show that it can be brought down to $O(nm + m^3 log m)$ without loss on the
  sampling’s exactness. In practice, we observe very substantial speedups compared
  to the classical algorithm as soon as n $>$ 1, 000. The algorithm described here
  is a close variant of the standard algorithm for sampling continuous DPPs, and uses
  rejection sampling. In the specific case of projection DPPs, we also show that any
  additional sample can be drawn in time $O(m^3 log m)$. Finally, an interesting by-product
  of the analysis is that a realisation from a DPP is typically contained in a subset
  of size $O(m \log m)$ formed using leverage score i.i.d. sampling.
