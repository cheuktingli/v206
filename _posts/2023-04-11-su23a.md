title: Coordinate Ascent for Off-Policy RL with Global Convergence Guarantees
software: https://github.com/NYCU-RL-Bandits-Lab/CAPO
abstract: We revisit the domain of off-policy policy optimization in RL from the perspective
  of coordinate ascent. One commonly-used approach is to leverage the off-policy policy
  gradient to optimize a surrogate objective â€“ the total discounted in expectation
  return of the target policy with respect to the state distribution of the behavior
  policy. However, this approach has been shown to suffer from the distribution mismatch
  issue, and therefore significant efforts are needed for correcting this mismatch
  either via state distribution correction or a counterfactual method. In this paper,
  we rethink off-policy learning via Coordinate Ascent Policy Optimization (CAPO),
  an off-policy actor-critic algorithm that decouples policy improvement from the
  state distribution of the behavior policy without using the policy gradient. This
  design obviates the need for distribution correction or importance sampling in the
  policy improvement step of off-policy policy gradient. We establish the global convergence
  of CAPO with general coordinate selection and then further quantify the convergence
  rates of several instances of CAPO with popular coordinate selection rules, including
  the cyclic and the randomized variants of CAPO. We then extend CAPO to neural policies
  for a more practical implementation. Through experiments, we demonstrate that CAPO
  provides a competitive approach to RL in practice.
