title: 'AdaGDA: Faster Adaptive Gradient Descent Ascent Methods for Minimax Optimization'
abstract: In the paper, we propose a class of faster adaptive Gradient Descent Ascent
  (GDA) methods for solving the nonconvex-strongly-concave minimax problems by using
  the unified adaptive matrices, which include almost all existing coordinate-wise
  and global adaptive learning rates. In particular, we provide an effective convergence
  analysis framework for our adaptive GDA methods. Specifically, we propose a fast
  Adaptive Gradient Descent Ascent (AdaGDA) method based on the basic momentum technique,
  which reaches a lower gradient complexity of $\tilde{O}(\kappa^4\epsilon^{-4})$
  for finding an $\epsilon$-stationary point without large batches, which improves
  the existing results of the adaptive GDA methods by a factor of $O(\sqrt{\kappa})$.
  Moreover, we propose an accelerated version of AdaGDA (VR-AdaGDA) method based on
  the momentum-based variance reduced technique, which achieves a lower gradient complexity
  of $\tilde{O}(\kappa^{4.5}\epsilon^{-3})$ for finding an $\epsilon$-stationary point
  without large batches, which improves the existing results of the adaptive GDA methods
  by a factor of $O(\epsilon^{-1})$. Moreover, we prove that our VR-AdaGDA method
  can reach the best known gradient complexity of $\tilde{O}(\kappa^{3}\epsilon^{-3})$
  with the mini-batch size $O(\kappa^3)$. The experiments on policy evaluation and
  fair classifier learning tasks are conducted to verify the efficiency of our new
  algorithms.
