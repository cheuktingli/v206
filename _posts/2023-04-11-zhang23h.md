title: Risk Bounds on Aleatoric Uncertainty Recovery
abstract: Quantifying aleatoric uncertainty is a challenging task in machine learning.
  It is important for decision making associated with data-dependent uncertainty in
  model outcomes. Recently, many empirical studies in modeling aleatoric uncertainty
  under regression settings primarily rely on either a Gaussian likelihood or moment
  matching. However, the performance of these methods varies for different datasets
  whereas discussions on their theoretical guarantees are lacking. In this work, we
  investigate theoretical aspects of these approaches and establish risk bounds for
  their estimates. We provide conditions that are sufficient to guarantee the PAC-learnablility
  of the aleatoric uncertainty. The study suggests that the likelihood and moment
  matching-based methods enjoy different types of guarantee in their risk bounds,
  i.e., they calibrate different aspects of the uncertainty and thus exhibit distinct
  properties in different regimes of the parameter space. Finally, we conduct empirical
  study which shows promising results and supports our theorems.
