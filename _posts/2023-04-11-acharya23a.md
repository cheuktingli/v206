title: Discrete Distribution Estimation under User-level Local Differential Privacy
software: https://github.com/Azulgrana1/user_level_LDP
abstract: 'We study discrete distribution estimation under user-level local differential
  privacy (LDP). In user-level $\varepsilon$-LDP, each user has a $m\ge1$ samples
  and the privacy of all $m$ samples must be preserved simultaneously. We resolve
  the following dilemma: While on the one hand having more samples per user should
  provide more information about the underlying distribution, on the other hand, guaranteeing
  privacy of all $m$ samples should make estimation task more difficult. We obtain
  tight bounds for this problem under almost all parameter regimes. Perhaps surprisingly,
  we show that in suitable parameter regimes, having $m$ samples per user is equivalent
  to having $m$ times more users, each with only one sample. Our results demonstrate
  interesting phase transitions for $m$ and the privacy parameter $\varepsilon$ in
  the estimation risk. Finally, connecting with recent results on shuffled DP, we
  show that combined with random shuffling, our algorithm leads to optimal error guarantees
  (up to logarithmic factors) under the central model of user-level DP in certain
  parameter regimes. We provide several simulations to verify our theoretical findings.'
