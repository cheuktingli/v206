title: Risk-aware linear bandits with convex loss
software: https://github.com/sauxpa/AISTATS2023-1315
abstract: In decision-making problems such as the multi-armed bandit, an agent learns
  sequentially by optimizing a certain feedback. While the mean reward criterion has
  been extensively studied, other measures that reflect an aversion to adverse outcomes,
  such as mean-variance or conditional value-at-risk (CVaR), can be of interest for
  critical applications (healthcare, agriculture). Algorithms have been proposed for
  such risk-aware measures under bandit feedback without contextual information. In
  this work, we study contextual bandits where such risk measures can be elicited
  as linear functions of the contexts through the minimization of a convex loss. A
  typical example that fits within this framework is the expectile measure, which
  is obtained as the solution of an asymmetric least-square problem. Using the method
  of mixtures for supermartingales, we derive confidence sequences for the estimation
  of such risk measures. We then propose an optimistic UCB algorithm to learn optimal
  risk-aware actions, with regret guarantees similar to those of generalized linear
  bandits. This approach requires solving a convex problem at each round of the algorithm,
  which we can relax by allowing only approximated solution obtained by online gradient
  descent, at the cost of slightly higher regret. We conclude by evaluating the resulting
  algorithms on numerical experiments.
