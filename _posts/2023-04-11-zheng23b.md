title: On the Consistency Rate of Decision Tree Learning Algorithms
software: https://www.lamda.nju.edu.cn/zhengqc/files/GridCART_codes.zip
abstract: Decision tree learning algorithms such as CART are generally based on heuristics
  that maximizes the purity gain greedily. Though these algorithms are practically
  successful, theoretical properties such as consistency are far from clear. In this
  paper, we discover that the most serious obstacle encumbering consistency analysis
  for decision tree learning algorithms lies in the fact that the worst-case purity
  gain, i.e., the core heuristics for tree splitting, can be zero. Based on this recognition,
  we present a new algorithm, named Grid Classification And Regression Tree (GridCART),
  with a provable consistency rate $\mathcal{O}(n^{-1 / (d + 2)})$, which is the first
  consistency rate proved for heuristic tree learning algorithms.
