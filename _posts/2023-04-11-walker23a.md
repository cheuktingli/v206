title: Unsupervised representation learning with recognition-parametrised probabilistic
  models
software: https://github.com/gatsby-sahani/rpm-aistats-2023
abstract: 'We introduce a new approach to probabilistic unsupervised learning based
  on the recognition-parametrised model (RPM): a normalised semi-parametric hypothesis
  class for joint distributions over observed and latent variables. Under the key
  assumption that observations are conditionally independent given latents, the RPM
  combines parametric prior and observation-conditioned latent distributions with
  non-parametric observation marginals. This approach leads to a flexible learnt recognition
  model capturing latent dependence between observations, without the need for an
  explicit, parametric generative model. The RPM admits exact maximum-likelihood learning
  for discrete latents, even for powerful neural network-based recognition. We develop
  effective approximations applicable in the continuous latent case. Experiments demonstrate
  the effectiveness of the RPM on high-dimensional data, learning image classification
  from weak indirect supervision; direct image-level latent Dirichlet allocation;
  and Recognition-Parametrised Gaussian Process Factor Analysis (RP-GPFA) applied
  to multi-factorial spatiotemporal datasets. The RPM provides a powerful framework
  to discover meaningful latent structure underlying observational data, a function
  critical to both animal and artificial intelligence.'
