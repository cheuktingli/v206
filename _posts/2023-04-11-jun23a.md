title: 'Average Adjusted Association: Efficient Estimation with High Dimensional Confounders'

abstract: The log odds ratio is a well-established metric for evaluating the association
  between binary outcome and exposure variables. Despite its widespread use, there
  has been limited discussion on how to summarize the log odds ratio as a function
  of confounders through averaging. To address this issue, we propose the Average
  Adjusted Association (AAA), which is a summary measure of association in a heterogeneous
  population, adjusted for observed confounders. To facilitate the use of it, we also
  develop efficient double/debiased machine learning (DML) estimators of the AAA.
  Our DML estimators use two equivalent forms of the efficient influence function,
  and are applicable in various sampling scenarios, including random sampling, outcome-based
  sampling, and exposure-based sampling. Through real data and simulations, we demonstrate
  the practicality and effectiveness of our proposed estimators in measuring the AAA.
