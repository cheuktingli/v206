title: Group Distributionally Robust Reinforcement Learning with Hierarchical Latent
  Variables
abstract: One key challenge for multi-task Reinforcement learning (RL) in practice
  is the absence of task specifications. Robust RL has been applied to deal with task
  ambiguity but may result in over-conservative policies. To balance the worst-case
  (robustness) and average performance, we propose Group Distributionally Robust Markov
  Decision Process (GDR-MDP), a flexible hierarchical MDP formulation that encodes
  task groups via a latent mixture model. GDR-MDP identifies the optimal policy that
  maximizes the expected return under the worst-possible qualified belief over task
  groups within an ambiguity set. We rigorously show that GDR-MDPâ€™s hierarchical structure
  improves distributional robustness by adding regularization to the worst possible
  outcomes. We then develop deep RL algorithms for GDR-MDP for both value-based and
  policy-based RL methods. Extensive experiments on Box2D control tasks, MuJoCo benchmarks,
  and Google football platforms show that our algorithms outperform classic robust
  training algorithms across diverse environments in terms of robustness under belief
  uncertainties. Demos are available on our project page (https://sites.google.com/view/gdr-rl/home).
