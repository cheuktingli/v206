title: Optimal Contextual Bandits with Knapsacks under Realizability via Regression
  Oracles
software: https://github.com/quejialin/SquareCBwK
abstract: We study the stochastic contextual bandit with knapsacks (CBwK) problem,
  where each action, taken upon a context, not only leads to a random reward but also
  costs a random resource consumption in a vector form. The challenge is to maximize
  the total reward without violating the budget for each resource. We study this problem
  under a general realizability setting where the expected reward and expected cost
  are functions of contexts and actions in some given general function classes $\mathcal{F}$
  and $\mathcal{G}$, respectively. Existing works on CBwK are restricted to the linear
  function class since they use UCB-type algorithms, which heavily rely on the linear
  form and thus are difficult to extend to general function classes. Motivated by
  online regression oracles that have been successfully applied to contextual bandits,
  we propose the first universal and optimal algorithmic framework for CBwK by reducing
  it to online regression. We also establish the lower regret bound to show the optimality
  of our algorithm for a variety of function classes.
