title: Wasserstein Distributionally Robust Linear-Quadratic Estimation under Martingale
  Constraints
abstract: We focus on robust estimation of the unobserved state of a discrete-time
  stochastic system with linear dynamics. A standard analysis of this estimation problem
  assumes a baseline innovation model; with Gaussian innovations we recover the Kalman
  filter. However, in many settings, there is insufficient or corrupted data to validate
  the baseline model. To cope with this problem, we minimize the worst-case mean-squared
  estimation error of adversarial models chosen within a Wasserstein neighborhood
  around the baseline. We also constrain the adversarial innovations to form a martingale
  difference sequence. The martingale constraint relaxes the i.i.d. assumptions which
  are often imposed on the baseline model. Moreover, we show that the martingale constraints
  guarantee that the adversarial dynamics remain adapted to the natural time-generated
  information. Therefore, adding the martingale constraint allows to improve upon
  over-conservative policies that also protect against unrealistic omniscient adversaries.
  We establish a strong duality result which we use to develop an efficient subgradient
  method to compute the distributionally robust estimation policy. If the baseline
  innovations are Gaussian, we show that the worst-case adversary remains Gaussian.
  Our numerical experiments indicate that the martingale constraint may also aid in
  adding a layer of robustness in the choice of the adversarial power.
