title: Discrete Langevin Samplers via Wasserstein Gradient Flow
software: https://github.com/google-research/google-research/tree/master/dwgf
abstract: It is known that gradient based MCMC samplers for continuous spaces, such
  as Langevin Monte Carlo (LMC), can be derived as particle versions of a gradient
  flow that minimizes KL divergence on a Wasserstein manifold. The superior efficiency
  of such samplers has motivated several recent attempts to generalize LMC to discrete
  spaces. However, a fully principled extension of Langevin dynamics to discrete has
  yet to be achieved, due to the lack of well-defined gradients in the sample space.
  In this work, we show how the Wasserstein gradient flow can be generalized naturally
  to discrete spaces. Given the proposed formulation, we demonstrate how a discrete
  analogue of Langevin dynamics can subsequently be developed. With this new understanding,
  we reveal how recent gradient-based samplers in discrete space can be obtained as
  special cases by choosing particular discretizations. More importantly, the framework
  also allows for the derivation of novel algorithms, one of which, discrete Langevin
  Monte Carlo (DLMC), is obtained by a factorized estimate of the transition matrix.
  The DLMC method admits a convenient parallel implementation and time-uniform sampling
  that achieves larger jump distances. We demonstrate the advantages of DLMC for sampling
  and learning in various binary and categorical distributions.
