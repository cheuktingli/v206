title: Causal Entropy Optimization
software: https://github.com/nicola144/CEO
abstract: We study the problem of globally optimizing the causal effect on a target
  variable of an unknown causal graph in which interventions can be performed. This
  problem arises in many areas of science including biology, operations research and
  healthcare. We propose Causal Entropy Optimization (CEO), a framework that generalizes
  Causal Bayesian Optimization (CBO) to account for all sources of uncertainty, including
  the one arising from the causal graph structure. CEO incorporates the causal structure
  uncertainty both in the surrogate models for the causal effects and in the mechanism
  used to select interventions via an information-theoretic acquisition function.
  The resulting algorithm automatically trades-off structure learning and causal effect
  optimization, while naturally accounting for observation noise. For various synthetic
  and real-world structural causal models, CEO achieves faster convergence to the
  global optimum compared with CBO while also learning the graph. Furthermore, our
  joint approach to structure learning and causal optimization improves upon sequential,
  structure-learning-first approaches.
