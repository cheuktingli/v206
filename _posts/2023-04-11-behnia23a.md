title: On the Implicit Geometry of Cross-Entropy Parameterizations for Label-Imbalanced
  Data
software: https://github.com/valavakilian/Implicit_geometry
abstract: Various logit-adjusted parameterizations of the cross-entropy (CE) loss
  have been proposed as alternatives to weighted CE for training large models on label-imbalanced
  data far beyond the zero train error regime. The driving force behind those designs
  has been the theory of implicit bias, which for linear(ized) models, explains why
  they successfully induce bias on the optimization path towards solutions that favor
  minorities. Aiming to extend this theory to non-linear models, we investigate the
  implicit geometry of classifiers and embeddings that are learned by different CE
  parameterizations. Our main result characterizes the global minimizers of a non-convex
  cost-sensitive SVM classifier for the unconstrained features model, which serves
  as an abstraction of deep-nets. We derive closed-form formulas for the angles and
  norms of classifiers and embeddings as a function of the number of classes, the
  imbalance and the minority ratios, and the loss hyperparameters. Using these, we
  show that logit-adjusted parameterizations can be appropriately tuned to learn symmetric
  geometries irrespective of the imbalance ratio. We complement our analysis with
  experiments and an empirical study of convergence accuracy in deep-nets.
