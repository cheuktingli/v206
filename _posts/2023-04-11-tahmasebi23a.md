title: The Power of Recursion in Graph Neural Networks for Counting Substructures
abstract: 'To achieve a graph representation, most Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) follow
  two steps: first, each graph is decomposed into a number of subgraphs (which we
  call the recursion step), and then the collection of subgraphs is encoded by several
  iterative pooling steps. While recently proposed higher-order networks show a remarkable
  increase in the expressive power through a single recursion on larger neighborhoods
  followed by iterative pooling, the power of deeper recursion in GNNs without any
  iterative pooling is still not fully understood. To make it concrete, we consider
  a pure recursion-based GNN which we call Recursive Neighborhood Pooling GNN (RNP-GNN).
  The expressive power of an RNP-GNN and its computational cost quantifies the power
  of (pure) recursion for a graph representation network. We quantify the power by
  means of counting substructures, which is one main limitation of the Message Passing
  graph Neural Networks (MPNNs), and show how RNP-GNN can exploit the sparsity of
  the underlying graph to achieve low-cost powerful representations. We also compare
  the recent lower bounds on the time complexity and show how recursion-based networks
  are near optimal.'
