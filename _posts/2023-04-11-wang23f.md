title: 'LOFT: Finding Lottery Tickets through Filter-wise Training'
abstract: Recent work on the Lottery Ticket Hypothesis (LTH) shows that there exist
  “winning tickets” in large neural networks. These tickets represent “sparse” versions
  of the full model that can be trained independently to achieve comparable accuracy
  with respect to the full model. However, finding the winning tickets requires one
  to pretrain the large model for at least a number of epochs, which can be a burdensome
  task, especially when the original neural network gets larger. In this paper, we
  explore how one can efficiently identify the emergence of such winning tickets,
  and use this observation to design efficient pretraining algorithms. For clarity
  of exposition, our focus is on convolutional neural networks (CNNs). To identify
  good filters, we propose a novel filter distance metric that well-represents the
  model convergence. As our theory dictates, our filter analysis behaves consistently
  with recent findings of neural network learning dynamics. Motivated by these observations,
  we present the LOttery ticket through Filter-wise Training algorithm, dubbed as
  LoFT. LoFT is a model-parallel pretraining algorithm that partitions convolutional
  layers by filters to train them independently in a distributed setting, resulting
  in reduced memory and communication costs during pretraining. Experiments show that
  LoFT i) preserves and finds good lottery tickets, while ii) it achieves non-trivial
  computation and communication savings, and maintains comparable or even better accuracy
  than other pretraining methods.
