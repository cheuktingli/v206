title: Bayesian Variable Selection in a Million Dimensions
software: https://github.com/BasisResearch/millipede
abstract: Bayesian variable selection is a powerful tool for data analysis, as it
  offers a principled method for variable selection that accounts for prior information
  and uncertainty. However, wider adoption of Bayesian variable selection has been
  hampered by computational challenges, especially in difficult regimes with a large
  number of covariates P or non-conjugate likelihoods. To scale to the large P regime
  we introduce an efficient Markov Chain Monte Carlo scheme whose cost per iteration
  is sublinear in P (though linear in the number of data points). In addition we show
  how this scheme can be extended to generalized linear models for count data, which
  are prevalent in biology, ecology, economics, and beyond. In particular we design
  efficient algorithms for variable selection in binomial and negative binomial regression,
  which includes logistic regression as a special case. In experiments we demonstrate
  the effectiveness of our methods, including on cancer and maize genomic data.
