title: Algorithm for Constrained Markov Decision Process with Linear Convergence
abstract: 'The problem of constrained Markov decision process is considered. An agent
  aims to maximize the expected accumulated discounted reward subject to multiple
  constraints on its costs (the number of constraints is relatively small). A new
  dual approach is proposed with the integration of two ingredients: entropy-regularized
  policy optimizer and Vaidyaâ€™s dual optimizer, both of which are critical to achieve
  faster convergence. The finite-time error bound of the proposed approach is provided.
  Despite the challenge of the nonconcave objective subject to nonconcave constraints,
  the proposed approach is shown to converge (with linear rate) to the global optimum.
  The complexity expressed in terms of the optimality gap and the constraint violation
  significantly improves upon the existing primal-dual approaches.'
