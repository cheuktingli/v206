title: Kernel Conditional Moment Constraints for Confounding Robust Inference
software: https://github.com/kstoneriv3/confounding-robust-inference
abstract: We study policy evaluation of offline contextual bandits subject to unobserved
  confounders. Sensitivity analysis methods are commonly used to estimate the policy
  value under the worst-case confounding over a given uncertainty set. However, existing
  work often resorts to some coarse relaxation of the uncertainty set for the sake
  of tractability, leading to overly conservative estimation of the policy value.
  In this paper, we propose a general estimator that provides a sharp lower bound
  of the policy value. It can be shown that our estimator contains the recently proposed
  sharp estimator by Dorn and Guo (2022) as a special case, and our method enables
  a novel extension of the classical marginal sensitivity model using f-divergence.
  To construct our estimator, we leverage the kernel method to obtain a tractable
  approximation to the conditional moment constraints, which traditional non-sharp
  estimators failed to take into account. In the theoretical analysis, we provide
  a condition for the choice of the kernel which guarantees no specification error
  that biases the lower bound estimation. Furthermore, we provide consistency guarantees
  of policy evaluation and learning. In the experiments with synthetic and real-world
  data, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.
