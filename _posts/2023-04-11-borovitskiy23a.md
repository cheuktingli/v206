title: Isotropic Gaussian Processes on Finite Spaces of Graphs
software: https://github.com/vsomnath/graph_space_gps
abstract: 'We propose a principled way to define Gaussian process priors on various
  sets of unweighted graphs: directed or undirected, with or without loops. We endow
  each of these sets with a geometric structure, inducing the notions of closeness
  and symmetries, by turning them into a vertex set of an appropriate metagraph. Building
  on this, we describe the class of priors that respect this structure and are analogous
  to the Euclidean isotropic processes, like squared exponential or Matérn. We propose
  an efficient computational technique for the ostensibly intractable problem of evaluating
  these priors’ kernels, making such Gaussian processes usable within the usual toolboxes
  and downstream applications. We go further to consider sets of equivalence classes
  of unweighted graphs and define the appropriate versions of priors thereon. We prove
  a hardness result, showing that in this case, exact kernel computation cannot be
  performed efficiently. However, we propose a simple Monte Carlo approximation for
  handling moderately sized cases. Inspired by applications in chemistry, we illustrate
  the proposed techniques on a real molecular property prediction task in the small
  data regime.'
