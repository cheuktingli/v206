title: No-regret Sample-efficient Bayesian Optimization for Finding Nash Equilibria
  with Unknown Utilities
software: https://github.com/sebtsh/nash-bo
abstract: The Nash equilibrium (NE) is a classic solution concept for normal-form
  games that is stable under potential unilateral deviations by self-interested agents.
  Bayesian optimization (BO) has been used to find NE in continuous general-sum games
  with unknown costly-to-sample utility functions in a sample-efficient manner. This
  paper presents the first no-regret BO algorithm that is sample-efficient in finding
  pure NE by leveraging theory on high probability confidence bounds with Gaussian
  processes and the maximum information gain of kernel functions. Unlike previous
  works, our algorithm is theoretically guaranteed to converge to the optimal solution
  (i.e., NE). We also introduce the novel setting of applying BO to finding mixed
  NE in unknown discrete general-sum games and show that our theoretical framework
  is general enough to be extended naturally to this setting by developing a no-regret
  BO algorithm that is sample-efficient in finding mixed NE. We empirically show that
  our algorithms are competitive w.r.t. suitable baselines in finding NE.
