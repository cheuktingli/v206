title: Efficient SAGE Estimation via Causal Structure Learning
software: https://github.com/gcskoenig/csl-experiments/tree/camera-ready
abstract: The Shapley Additive Global Importance (SAGE) value is a theoretically appealing
  interpretability method that fairly attributes global importance to a model’s surplus
  performance contributions over an exponential number of feature sets. This is computationally
  expensive, particularly because estimating the surplus contributions requires sampling
  from conditional distributions. Thus, SAGE approximation algorithms only take a
  fraction of the feature sets into account. We propose d-SAGE, a method that accelerates
  SAGE approximation. d-SAGE is motivated by the observation that conditional independencies
  (CIs) between a feature and the model target imply zero surplus contributions, such
  that their computation can be skipped. To identify CIs, we leverage causal structure
  learning (CSL) to infer a graph that encodes (conditional) independencies in the
  data as d-separations. This is computationally more efficient because the expense
  of the one-time graph inference and the d-separation queries is negligible compared
  to the expense of surplus contribution evaluations. Empirically we demonstrate that
  d-SAGE enables the efficient and accurate estimation of SAGE values.
