title: Provable Safe Reinforcement Learning with Binary Feedback
software: https://github.com/CausalML/SABRE
abstract: Safety is a crucial necessity in many applications of reinforcement learning
  (RL), whether robotic, automotive, or medical. Many existing approaches to safe
  RL rely on receiving numeric safety feedback, but in many cases this feedback can
  only take binary values; that is, whether an action in a given state is safe or
  unsafe. This is particularly true when feedback comes from human experts. We therefore
  consider the problem of provable safe RL when given access to an offline oracle
  providing binary feedback on the safety of state, action pairs. We provide a novel
  meta algorithm, SABRE, which can be applied to any MDP setting given access to a
  blackbox PAC RL algorithm for that setting. SABRE applies concepts from active learning
  to reinforcement learning to provably control the number of queries to the safety
  oracle. SABRE works by iteratively exploring the state space to find regions where
  the agent is currently uncertain about safety. Our main theoretical results shows
  that, under appropriate technical assumptions, SABRE never takes unsafe actions
  during training, and is guaranteed to return a near-optimal safe policy with high
  probability. We provide a discussion of how our meta-algorithm may be applied to
  various settings studied in both theoretical and empirical frameworks.
