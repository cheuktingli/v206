title: Hierarchical-Hyperplane Kernels for Actively Learning Gaussian Process Models
  of Nonstationary Systems
software: https://github.com/boschresearch/Hierarchical-Hyperplane-Kernels
abstract: 'Learning precise surrogate models of complex computer simulations and physical
  machines often require long-lasting or expensive experiments. Furthermore, the modeled
  physical dependencies exhibit nonlinear and nonstationary behavior. Machine learning
  methods that are used to produce the surrogate model should therefore address these
  problems by providing a scheme to keep the number of queries small, e.g. by using
  active learning and be able to capture the nonlinear and nonstationary properties
  of the system. One way of modeling the nonstationarity is to induce input-partitioning,
  a principle that has proven to be advantageous in active learning for Gaussian processes.
  However, these methods either assume a known partitioning, need to introduce complex
  sampling schemes or rely on very simple geometries. In this work, we present a simple,
  yet powerful kernel family that incorporates a partitioning that: i) is learnable
  via gradient-based methods, ii) uses a geometry that is more flexible than previous
  ones, while still being applicable in the low data regime. Thus, it provides a good
  prior for active learning procedures. We empirically demonstrate excellent performance
  on various active learning tasks.'
