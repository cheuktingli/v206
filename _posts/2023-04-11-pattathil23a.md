title: Symmetric (Optimistic) Natural Policy Gradient for Multi-Agent Learning with
  Parameter Convergence
abstract: 'Multi-agent interactions are increasingly important in the context of reinforcement
  learning, and the theoretical foundations of policy gradient methods have attracted
  surging research interest. We investigate the global convergence of natural policy
  gradient (NPG) algorithms in multi-agent learning. We first show that vanilla NPG
  may not have parameter convergence, i.e., the convergence of the vector that parameterizes
  the policy, even when the payoffs are regularized (which enabled strong convergence
  guarantees in the policy space in the literature). This non-convergence of parameters
  leads to stability issues in learning, which becomes especially relevant in the
  function approximation setting, where we can only operate on low-dimensional parameters,
  instead of the high-dimensional policy. We then propose variants of the NPG algorithm,
  for several standard multi-agent learning scenarios: two-player zero-sum matrix
  and Markov games, and multi-player monotone games, with global last-iterate parameter
  convergence guarantees. We also generalize the results to certain function approximation
  settings. Note that in our algorithms, the agents take symmetric roles. Our results
  might also be of independent interest for solving nonconvex-nonconcave minimax optimization
  problems with certain structures. Simulations are also provided to corroborate our
  theoretical findings.'
