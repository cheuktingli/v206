title: 'Generalized PTR: User-Friendly Recipes for Data-Adaptive Algorithms with Differential
  Privacy'
software: https://github.com/jeremy43/Generalized_PTR
abstract: The “Propose-Test-Release” (PTR) framework [Dwork and Lei, 2009] is a classic
  recipe for designing differentially private (DP) algorithms that are data-adaptive,
  i.e. those that add less noise when the input dataset is “nice”. We extend PTR to
  a more general setting by privately testing data-dependent privacy losses rather
  than local sensitivity, hence making it applicable beyond the standard noise-adding
  mechanisms, e.g. to queries with unbounded or undefined sensitivity. We demonstrate
  the versatility of generalized PTR using private linear regression as a case study.
  Additionally, we apply our algorithm to solve an open problem from “Private Aggregation
  of Teacher Ensembles (PATE)” [Papernot et al., 2017, 2018] - privately releasing
  the entire model with a delicate data-dependent analysis.
