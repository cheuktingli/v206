title: Model-Based Uncertainty in Value Functions
software: https://github.com/boschresearch/ube-mbrl
abstract: We consider the problem of quantifying uncertainty over expected cumulative
  rewards in model-based reinforcement learning. In particular, we focus on characterizing
  the variance over values induced by a distribution over MDPs. Previous work upper
  bounds the posterior variance over values by solving a so-called uncertainty Bellman
  equation, but the over-approximation may result in inefficient exploration. We propose
  a new uncertainty Bellman equation whose solution converges to the true posterior
  variance over values and explicitly characterizes the gap in previous work. Moreover,
  our uncertainty quantification technique is easily integrated into common exploration
  strategies and scales naturally beyond the tabular setting by using standard deep
  reinforcement learning architectures. Experiments in difficult exploration tasks,
  both in tabular and continuous control settings, show that our sharper uncertainty
  estimates improve sample-efficiency.
