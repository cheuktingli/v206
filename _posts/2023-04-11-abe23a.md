title: Last-Iterate Convergence with Full and Noisy Feedback in Two-Player Zero-Sum
  Games
software: https://github.com/CyberAgentAILab/m2wu
abstract: This paper proposes Mutation-Driven Multiplicative Weights Update (M2WU)
  for learning an equilibrium in two-player zero-sum normal-form games and proves
  that it exhibits the last-iterate convergence property in both full and noisy feedback
  settings. In the former, players observe their exact gradient vectors of the utility
  functions. In the latter, they only observe the noisy gradient vectors. Even the
  celebrated Multiplicative Weights Update (MWU) and Optimistic MWU (OMWU) algorithms
  may not converge to a Nash equilibrium with noisy feedback. On the contrary, M2WU
  exhibits the last-iterate convergence to a stationary point near a Nash equilibrium
  in both feedback settings. We then prove that it converges to an exact Nash equilibrium
  by iteratively adapting the mutation term. We empirically confirm that M2WU outperforms
  MWU and OMWU in exploitability and convergence rates.
