title: Fitting low-rank models on egocentrically sampled partial networks
software: https://github.com/Anguscgm/LE
abstract: 'The statistical modeling of random networks has been widely used to uncover
  interaction mechanisms in complex systems and to predict unobserved links in real-world
  networks. In many applications, network connections are collected via egocentric
  sampling: a subset of nodes is sampled first, after which all links involving this
  subset are recorded; all other information is missing. Compared with the assumption
  of “uniformly missing at random”, egocentrically sampled partial networks require
  specially designed modeling strategies. Current statistical methods are either computationally
  infeasible or based on intuitive designs without theoretical justification. Here,
  we propose an approach to fit general low-rank models for egocentrically sampled
  networks, which include several popular network models. This method is based on
  graph spectral properties and is computationally efficient for large-scale networks.
  It results in consistent recovery of missing subnetworks due to egocentric sampling
  for sparse networks. To our knowledge, this method offers the first theoretical
  guarantee for egocentric partial network estimation in the scope of low-rank models.
  We evaluate the technique on several synthetic and real-world networks and show
  that it delivers competitive performance in link prediction tasks.'
