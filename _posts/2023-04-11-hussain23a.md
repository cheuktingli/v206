title: Falsification of Internal and External Validity in Observational Studies via
  Conditional Moment Restrictions
abstract: Randomized Controlled Trials (RCT)s are relied upon to assess new treatments,
  but suffer from limited power to guide personalized treatment decisions. On the
  other hand, observational (i.e., non-experimental) studies have large and diverse
  populations, but are prone to various biases (e.g. residual confounding). To safely
  leverage the strengths of observational studies, we focus on the problem of falsification,
  whereby RCTs are used to validate causal effect estimates learned from observational
  data. In particular, we show that, given data from both an RCT and an observational
  study, assumptions on internal and external validity have an observable, testable
  implication in the form of a set of Conditional Moment Restrictions (CMRs). Further,
  we show that expressing these CMRs with respect to the causal effect, or “causal
  contrast”, as opposed to individual counterfactual means, provides a more reliable
  falsification test. In addition to giving guarantees on the asymptotic properties
  of our test, we demonstrate superior power and type I error of our approach on semi-synthetic
  and real world datasets. Our approach is interpretable, allowing a practitioner
  to visualize which subgroups in the population lead to falsification of an observational
  study.
