title: Iterative Teaching by Data Hallucination
software: https://github.com/Zeju1997/data_halucination_teaching
abstract: We consider the problem of iterative machine teaching, where a teacher sequentially
  provides examples based on the status of a learner under a discrete input space
  (i.e., a pool of finite samples), which greatly limits the teacher’s capability.
  To address this issue, we study iterative teaching under a continuous input space
  where the input example (i.e., image) can be either generated by solving an optimization
  problem or drawn directly from a continuous distribution. Specifically, we propose
  data hallucination teaching (DHT) where the teacher can generate input data intelligently
  based on labels, the learner’s status and the target concept. We study a number
  of challenging teaching setups (e.g., linear/neural learners in omniscient and black-box
  settings). Extensive empirical results verify the effectiveness of DHT.
