title: 'DIET: Conditional independence testing with marginal dependence measures of
  residual information'
abstract: 'Conditional randomization tests (CRTs) assess whether a variable $x$ is
  predictive of another variable $y$, having observed covariates $z$. CRTs require
  fitting a large number of predictive models, which is often computationally intractable.
  Existing solutions to reduce the cost of CRTs typically split the dataset into a
  train and test portion, or rely on heuristics for interactions, both of which lead
  to a loss in power. We propose the decoupled independence test (DIET), an algorithm
  that avoids both of these issues by leveraging marginal independence statistics
  to test conditional independence relationships. DIET tests the marginal independence
  of two random variables: $F_{x\vert z}(x \vert z)$ and $F_{y\vert z}(y \vert z)$
  where $F_{\cdot \vert z}(\cdot \vert z)$ is a conditional cumulative distribution
  function (CDF) for the distribution $p(\cdot \vert z)$. These variables are termed
  “information residuals.” We give sufficient conditions for DIET to achieve finite
  sample type-1 error control and power greater than the type-1 error rate. We then
  prove that when using the mutual information between the information residuals as
  a test statistic, DIET yields the most powerful conditionally valid test. Finally,
  we show DIET achieves higher power than other tractable CRTs on several synthetic
  and real benchmarks.'
