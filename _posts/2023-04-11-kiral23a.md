title: The Lie-Group Bayesian Learning Rule
software: https://github.com/team-approx-bayes/liegroups
abstract: The Bayesian Learning Rule provides a framework for generic algorithm design
  but can be difficult to use for three reasons. First, it requires a specific parameterization
  of exponential family. Second, it uses gradients which can be difficult to compute.
  Third, its update may not always stay on the manifold. We address these difficulties
  by proposing an extension based on Lie-groups where posteriors are parametrized
  through transformations of an arbitrary base distribution and updated via the group’s
  exponential map. This simplifies all three difficulties for many cases, providing
  flexible parametrizations through group’s action, simple gradient computation through
  reparameterization, and updates that always stay on the manifold. We use the new
  learning rule to derive a new algorithm for deep learning with desirable biologically-plausible
  attributes to learn sparse features. Our work opens a new frontier for the design
  of new algorithms by exploiting lie-group structures.
