title: 'Generalization in Graph Neural Networks: Improved PAC-Bayesian Bounds on Graph
  Diffusion'
software: https://github.com/NEU-StatsML-Research/Noise-Stability-Optimization-for-Fintuning-GNNs
abstract: Graph neural networks are widely used tools for graph prediction tasks.
  Motivated by their empirical performance, prior works have developed generalization
  bounds for graph neural networks, which scale with graph structures in terms of
  the maximum degree. In this paper, we present generalization bounds that instead
  scale with the largest singular value of the graph neural network’s feature diffusion
  matrix. These bounds are numerically much smaller than prior bounds for real-world
  graphs. We also construct a lower bound of the generalization gap that matches our
  upper bound asymptotically. To achieve these results, we analyze a unified model
  that includes prior works’ settings (i.e., convolutional and message-passing networks)
  and new settings (i.e., graph isomorphism networks). Our key idea is to measure
  the stability of graph neural networks against noise perturbations using Hessians.
  Empirically, we find that Hessian-based measurements correlate with observed generalization
  gaps of graph neural networks accurately; Optimizing noise stability properties
  for fine-tuning pretrained graph neural networks also improves the test performance
  on several graph-level classification tasks.
