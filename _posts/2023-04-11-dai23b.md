title: Learning to Optimize with Stochastic Dominance Constraints
software: https://github.com/google-research/googleresearch/tree/master/lightsd
abstract: In real-world decision-making, uncertainty is important yet difficult to
  handle. Stochastic dominance provides a theoretically sound approach to comparing
  uncertain quantities, but optimization with stochastic dominance constraints is
  often computationally expensive, which limits practical applicability. In this paper,
  we develop a simple yet efficient approach for the problem, Light Stochastic Dominance
  Solver (light-SD), by leveraging properties of the Lagrangian. We recast the inner
  optimization in the Lagrangian as a learning problem for surrogate approximation,
  which bypasses the intractability and leads to tractable updates or even closed-form
  solutions for gradient calculations. We prove convergence of the algorithm and test
  it empirically. The proposed light-SD demonstrates superior performance on several
  representative problems ranging from finance to supply chain management.
