title: A Unified Perspective on Regularization and Perturbation in Differentiable
  Subset Selection
software: https://github.com/xqsun4/subset-selction
abstract: 'Subset selection, i.e., finding a bunch of items from a collection to achieve
  specific goals, has wide applications in information retrieval, statistics, and
  machine learning. To implement an end-to-end learning framework, different relaxed
  differentiable operators of subset selection are proposed. Most existing work relies
  on either the regularization method or the perturbation method. In this work, we
  provide a probabilistic interpretation for regularization relaxation and unify two
  schemes. Besides, we build some concrete examples to show the generic connection
  between these two relaxations. Finally, we evaluate the perturbed selector as well
  as the regularized selector on two tasks: the maximum entropy sampling problem and
  the feature selection problem. The experimental results show that these two methods
  can achieve competitive performance against other benchmarks.'
