title: Multi-Fidelity Bayesian Optimization with Unreliable Information Sources
software: https://github.com/AaltoPML/rMFBO
abstract: Bayesian optimization (BO) is a powerful framework for optimizing black-box,
  expensive-to-evaluate functions. Over the past decade, many algorithms have been
  proposed to integrate cheaper, lower-fidelity approximations of the objective function
  into the optimization process, with the goal of converging towards the global optimum
  at a reduced cost. This task is generally referred to as multi-fidelity Bayesian
  optimization (MFBO). However, MFBO algorithms can lead to higher optimization costs
  than their vanilla BO counterparts, especially when the low-fidelity sources are
  poor approximations of the objective function, therefore defeating their purpose.
  To address this issue, we propose rMFBO (robust MFBO), a methodology to make any
  GP-based MFBO scheme robust to the addition of unreliable information sources. rMFBO
  comes with a theoretical guarantee that its performance can be bound to its vanilla
  BO analog, with high controllable probability. We demonstrate the effectiveness
  of the proposed methodology on a number of numerical benchmarks, outperforming earlier
  MFBO methods on unreliable sources. We expect rMFBO to be particularly useful to
  reliably include human experts with varying knowledge within BO processes.
