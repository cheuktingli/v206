title: 'Towards Scalable and Robust Structured Bandits: A Meta-Learning Framework'
software: https://github.com/linlinlin97/MTSS
abstract: Online learning in large-scale structured bandits is known to be challenging
  due to the curse of dimensionality. In this paper, we propose a unified meta-learning
  framework for a wide class of structured bandit problems where the parameter space
  can be factorized to item-level, which covers many popular tasks. Compared with
  existing approaches, the proposed solution is both scalable to large systems and
  robust by utilizing a more flexible model. At the core of this framework is a Bayesian
  hierarchical model that allows information sharing among items via their features,
  upon which we design a meta Thompson sampling algorithm. Three representative examples
  are discussed thoroughly. Theoretical analysis and extensive numerical results both
  support the usefulness of the proposed method.
