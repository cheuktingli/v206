title: Efficient Informed Proposals for Discrete Distributions via Newton’s Series
  Approximation
software: https://github.com/DongyaoZhu/Newton-Proposal-for-Discrete-Sampling
abstract: Gradients have been exploited in proposal distributions to accelerate the
  convergence of Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms on discrete distributions. However,
  these methods require a natural differentiable extension of the target discrete
  distribution, which often does not exist or does not provide effective guidance.
  In this paper, we develop a gradient-like proposal for any discrete distribution
  without this strong requirement. Built upon a locally-balanced proposal, our method
  efficiently approximates the discrete likelihood ratio via Newton’s series expansion
  to enable a large and efficient exploration in discrete spaces. We show that our
  method can also be viewed as a multilinear extension, thus inheriting the desired
  properties. We prove that our method has a guaranteed convergence rate with or without
  the Metropolis-Hastings step. Furthermore, our method outperforms a number of popular
  alternatives in several different experiments, including the facility location problem,
  extractive text summarization, and image retrieval.
