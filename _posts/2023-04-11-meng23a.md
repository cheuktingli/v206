title: On Model Selection Consistency of Lasso for High-Dimensional Ising Models
abstract: We theoretically analyze the model selection consistency of least absolute
  shrinkage and selection operator (Lasso), both with and without post-thresholding,
  for high-dimensional Ising models. For random regular (RR) graphs of size $p$ with
  regular node degree $d$ and uniform couplings $\theta_0$, it is rigorously proved
  that Lasso without post-thresholding is model selection consistent in the whole
  paramagnetic phase with the same order of sample complexity $n=\Omega{(d^3\log{p})}$
  as that of $\ell_1$-regularized logistic regression ($\ell_1$-LogR). This result
  is consistent with the conjecture in Meng, Obuchi, and Kabashima 2021 using the
  non-rigorous replica method from statistical physics and thus complements it with
  a rigorous proof. For general tree-like graphs, it is demonstrated that the same
  result as RR graphs can be obtained under mild assumptions of the dependency condition
  and incoherence condition. Moreover, we provide a rigorous proof of the model selection
  consistency of Lasso with post-thresholding for general tree-like graphs in the
  paramagnetic phase without further assumptions on the dependency and incoherence
  conditions. Experimental results agree well with our theoretical analysis.
