title: Probing Graph Representations
software: https://github.com/msadegh97/probing-graph-representation
abstract: Today we have a good theoretical understanding of the representational power
  of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). For example, their limitations have been characterized
  in relation to a hierarchy of Weisfeiler-Lehman (WL) isomorphism tests. However,
  we do not know what is encoded in the learned representations. This is our main
  question. We answer it using a probing framework to quantify the amount of meaningful
  information captured in graph representations. Our findings on molecular datasets
  show the potential of probing for understanding the inductive biases of graph-based
  models. We compare different families of models, and show that Graph Transformers
  capture more chemically relevant information compared to models based on message
  passing. We also study the effect of different design choices such as skip connections
  and virtual nodes. We advocate for probing as a useful diagnostic tool for evaluating
  and developing graph-based models.
