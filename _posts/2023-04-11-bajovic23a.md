title: Large deviations rates for stochastic gradient descent with strongly convex
  functions
abstract: Recent works have shown that high probability metrics with stochastic gradient
  descent (SGD) exhibit informativeness and in some cases advantage over the commonly
  adopted mean-square error-based ones. In this work we provide a formal framework
  for the study of general high probability bounds with SGD, based on the theory of
  large deviations. The framework allows for a generic (not-necessarily bounded) gradient
  noise satisfying mild technical assumptions, allowing for the dependence of the
  noise distribution on the current iterate. Under the preceding assumptions, we find
  an upper large deviations bound for SGD with strongly convex functions. The corresponding
  rate function captures analytical dependence on the noise distribution and other
  problem parameters. This is in contrast with conventional mean-square error analysis
  that captures only the noise dependence through the variance and does not capture
  the effect of higher order moments nor interplay between the noise geometry and
  the shape of the cost function. We also derive exact large deviation rates for the
  case when the objective function is quadratic and show that the obtained function
  matches the one from the general upper bound hence showing the tightness of the
  general upper bound. Numerical examples illustrate and corroborate theoretical findings.
