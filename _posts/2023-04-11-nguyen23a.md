title: Optimal and Private Learning from Human Response Data
software: https://github.com/dnguyen1196/spectral-rasch
abstract: 'Item response theory (IRT) is the study of how people make probabilistic
  decisions, with diverse applications in education testing, recommendation systems,
  among others. The Rasch model of binary response data, one of the most fundamental
  models in IRT, remains an active area of research with important practical significance.
  Recently, Nguyen and Zhang (2022) proposed a new spectral estimation algorithm that
  is efficient and accurate. In this work, we extend their results in two important
  ways. Firstly, we obtain a refined entrywise error bound for the spectral algorithm,
  complementing the ‘average error’ $\ell_2$ bound in their work. Notably, under mild
  sampling conditions, the spectral algorithm achieves the minimax optimal entrywise
  error bound (modulo a log factor). Building on the refined analysis, we also show
  that the spectral algorithm enjoys optimal sample complexity for top-$K$ recovery
  (e.g., identifying the best $K$ items from approval/disapproval response data),
  explaining interesting empirical findings in the previous work. Our second contribution
  addresses an important but understudied topic in IRT: privacy. Despite the human-centric
  applications of IRT, there has not been any proposed privacy-preserving mechanism
  in the literature. We develop a private extension of the spectral algorithm, leveraging
  its unique Markov chain formulation and the discrete Gaussian mechanism (Canonne
  et al., 2020). Experiments show that our approach is significantly more accurate
  than the baselines in the low-to-moderate privacy regime.'
