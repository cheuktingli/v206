title: Efficient Planning in Combinatorial Action Spaces with Applications to Cooperative
  Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning
abstract: A practical challenge in reinforcement learning are combinatorial action
  spaces that make planning computationally demanding. For example, in cooperative
  multi-agent reinforcement learning, a potentially large number of agents jointly
  optimize a global reward function, which leads to a combinatorial blow-up in the
  action space by the number of agents. As a minimal requirement, we assume access
  to an argmax oracle that allows to efficiently compute the greedy policy for any
  Q-function in the model class. Building on recent work in planning with local access
  to a simulator and linear function approximation, we propose efficient algorithms
  for this setting that lead to polynomial compute and query complexity in all relevant
  problem parameters. For the special case where the feature decomposition is additive,
  we further improve the bounds and extend the results to the kernelized setting with
  an efficient algorithm.
