title: Tensor-based Kernel Machines with Structured Inducing Points for Large and
  High-Dimensional Data
software: https://github.com/fwesel/CPD-SIP/
abstract: Kernel machines are one of the most studied family of methods in machine
  learning. In the exact setting, training requires to instantiate the kernel matrix,
  thereby prohibiting their application to large-sampled data. One popular kernel
  approximation strategy which allows to tackle large-sampled data consists in interpolating
  product kernels on a set of grid-structured inducing points. However, since the
  number of model parameters increases exponentially with the dimensionality of the
  data, these methods are limited to small-dimensional datasets. In this work we lift
  this limitation entirely by placing inducing points on a grid and constraining the
  primal weights to be a low-rank Canonical Polyadic Decomposition. We derive a block
  coordinate descent algorithm that efficiently exploits grid-structured inducing
  points. The computational complexity of the algorithm scales linearly both in the
  number of samples and in the dimensionality of the data for any product kernel.
  We demonstrate the performance of our algorithm on large-scale and high-dimensional
  data, achieving state-of-the art results on a laptop computer. Our results show
  that grid-structured approaches can work in higher-dimensional problems.
