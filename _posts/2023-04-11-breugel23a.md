title: Membership Inference Attacks against Synthetic Data through Overfitting Detection
software: https://github.com/vanderschaarlab/DOMIAS
abstract: Data is the foundation of most science. Unfortunately, sharing data can
  be obstructed by the risk of violating data privacy, impeding research in fields
  like healthcare. Synthetic data is a potential solution. It aims to generate data
  that has the same distribution as the original data, but that does not disclose
  information about individuals. Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs) are a common
  privacy attack, in which the attacker attempts to determine whether a particular
  real sample was used for training of the model. Previous works that propose MIAs
  against generative models either display low performance—giving the false impression
  that data is highly private—or need to assume access to internal generative model
  parameters—a relatively low-risk scenario, as the data publisher often only releases
  synthetic data, not the model. In this work we argue for a realistic MIA setting
  that assumes the attacker has some knowledge of the underlying data distribution.
  We propose DOMIAS, a density-based MIA model that aims to infer membership by targeting
  local overfitting of the generative model. Experimentally we show that DOMIAS is
  significantly more successful at MIA than previous work, especially at attacking
  uncommon samples. The latter is disconcerting since these samples may correspond
  to underrepresented groups. We also demonstrate how DOMIAS’ MIA performance score
  provides an interpretable metric for privacy, giving data publishers a new tool
  for achieving the desired privacy-utility trade-off in their synthetic data.
