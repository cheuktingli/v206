title: On the Capacity Limits of Privileged ERM
abstract: We study the supervised learning paradigm called Learning Using Privileged
  Information, first suggested by Vapnik and Vashist (2009). In this paradigm, in
  addition to the examples and labels, additional (privileged) information is provided
  only for training examples. The goal is to use this information to improve the classification
  accuracy of the resulting classifier, where this classifier can only use the non-privileged
  information of new example instances to predict their label. We study the theory
  of privileged learning with the zero-one loss under the natural Privileged ERM algorithm
  proposed in Peshyony and Vapnik (2010). We provide a counter example to a claim
  made in that work regarding the VC dimension of the loss class induced by this problem;
  We conclude that the claim is incorrect. We then provide a correct VC dimension
  analysis which gives both lower and upper bounds on the capacity of the Privileged
  ERM loss class. We further show, via a generalization analysis, that worst-case
  guarantees for Privileged ERM cannot improve over standard non-privileged ERM, unless
  the capacity of the privileged information is similar or smaller to that of the
  non-privileged information. This result points to an important limitation of the
  Privileged ERM approach. In our closing discussion, we suggest another way in which
  Privileged ERM might still be helpful, even when the capacity of the privileged
  information is large.
