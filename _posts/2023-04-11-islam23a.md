title: Representation Learning in Deep RL via Discrete Information Bottleneck
abstract: Several self-supervised representation learning methods have been proposed
  for reinforcement learning (RL) with rich observations. For real world applications
  of RL, recovering underlying latent states is crucial, particularly when sensory
  inputs can contain irrelevant and exogenous information. In this work, we study
  how information bottlenecjs can be used to construct latent states efficiently in
  the presence of task irrelevant information. We propose architectures that utilize
  variational and discrete information bottleneck, coined as RepDIB, to learn structured
  factorized representations. Exploiting the expressiveness bought by factorized representations,
  we introduce a simple, yet effective, bottleneck that can be integrated with any
  existing self supervised objective for RL. We demonstrate this across several online
  and offline RL benchmarks, along with a real robot arm task, where we find that
  compressed representations with RepDIB can lead to strong performance improvements,
  as the learnt bottlenecks can help predict only the relevant state, while ignoring
  irrelevant information.
