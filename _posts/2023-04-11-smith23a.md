title: Prediction-Oriented Bayesian Active Learning
abstract: Information-theoretic approaches to active learning, such as BALD, typically
  focus on maximising the information gathered about the model parameters. We highlight
  that this can be suboptimal from the perspective of predictive performance. In particular,
  BALD fails to account for the input distribution and thus is prone to prioritise
  data that is of low relevance to prediction. Addressing this shortfall, we propose
  the expected predictive information gain (EPIG), an acquisition function that measures
  information gain in the space of predictions rather than parameters. We find that
  using EPIG leads to stronger predictive performance compared with BALD across a
  range of datasets and models, and thus provides an appealing drop-in replacement.
