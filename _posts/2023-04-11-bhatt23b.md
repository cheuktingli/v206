title: Piecewise Stationary Bandits under Risk Criteria
abstract: 'Piecewise stationary stochastic multi-armed bandits have been extensively
  explored in the risk-neutral and sub-Gaussian setting. In this work, we consider
  a multi-armed bandit framework in which the reward distributions are heavy-tailed
  and non-stationary, and evaluate the performance of algorithms using general risk
  criteria. Specifically, we make the following contributions: (i) We first propose
  a non-parametric change detection algorithm that can detect general distributional
  changes in heavy-tailed distributions. (ii)We then propose a truncation-based UCB-type
  bandit algorithm integrating the above regime change detection algorithm to minimize
  the regret of the non-stationary learning problem. (iii) Finally, we establish the
  regret bounds for the proposed bandit algorithm by characterizing the statistical
  properties of the general change detection algorithm, along with a novel regret
  analysis.'
