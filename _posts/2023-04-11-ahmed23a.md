title: Semantic Strengthening of Neuro-Symbolic Learning
software: https://github.com/UCLA-StarAI/Semantic-Strengthening
abstract: 'Numerous neuro-symbolic approaches have recently been proposed typically
  with the goal of adding symbolic knowledge to the output layer of a neural network.
  Ideally, such losses maximize the probability that the neural network’s predictions
  satisfy the underlying domain. Unfortunately, this type of probabilistic inference
  is often computationally infeasible. Neuro-symbolic approaches therefore commonly
  resort to fuzzy approximations of this probabilistic objective, sacrificing sound
  probabilistic semantics, or to sampling which is very seldom feasible. We approach
  the problem by first assuming the constraint decomposes conditioned on the features
  learned by the network. We iteratively strengthen our approximation, restoring the
  dependence between the constraints most responsible for degrading the quality of
  the approximation. This corresponds to computing the mutual information between
  pairs of constraints conditioned on the network’s learned features, and may be construed
  as a measure of how well aligned the gradients of two distributions are. We show
  how to compute this efficiently for tractable circuits. We test our approach on
  three tasks: predicting a minimum-cost path in Warcraft, predicting a minimum-cost
  perfect matching, and solving Sudoku puzzles, observing that it improves upon the
  baselines while sidestepping intractability.'
