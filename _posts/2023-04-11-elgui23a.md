title: A Statistical Learning Take on the Concordance Index for Survival Analysis
software: https://github.com/owkin/owkin-metric
abstract: The introduction of machine learning (ML) techniques to the field of survival
  analysis has increased the flexibility of modeling approaches, and ML based models
  have become state-of-the-art. These models optimize their own cost functions, and
  their performance is often evaluated using the concordance index (C-index). From
  a statistical learning perspective, it is therefore an important problem to analyze
  the relationship between the optimizers of the C-index and those of the ML cost
  functions. We address this issue by providing C-index Fisher-consistency results
  and excess risk bounds for several of the commonly used cost functions in survival
  analysis. We identify conditions under which they are consistent, under the form
  of three nested families of survival models. We also study the general case where
  no model assumption is made and present a new, off-the-shelf method that is shown
  to be consistent with the C-index, although computationally expensive at inference.
  Finally, we perform limited numerical experiments with simulated data to illustrate
  our theoretical findings.
