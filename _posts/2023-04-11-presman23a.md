title: Distance-to-Set Priors and Constrained Bayesian Inference
software: https://github.com/rpresman/dist_to_set_priors
abstract: Constrained learning is prevalent in many statistical tasks. Recent work
  proposes distance-to-set penalties to derive estimators under general constraints
  that can be specified as sets, but focuses on obtaining point estimates that do
  not come with corresponding measures of uncertainty. To remedy this, we approach
  distance-to-set regularization from a Bayesian lens. We consider a class of smooth
  distance-to-set priors, showing that they yield well-defined posteriors toward quantifying
  uncertainty for constrained learning problems. We discuss relationships and advantages
  over prior work on Bayesian constraint relaxation. Moreover, we prove that our approach
  is optimal in an information geometric-sense for finite penalty parameters $\rho$,
  and enjoys favorable statistical properties when $\rho \rightarrow \infty$. The
  method is designed to perform effectively within gradient based MCMC samplers, as
  illustrated on a suite of simulated and real data applications.
