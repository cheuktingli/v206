title: Influence Diagnostics under Self-concordance
software: https://github.com/jfisher52/influence_theory
abstract: Influence diagnostics such as influence functions and approximate maximum
  influence perturbations are popular in machine learning and in AI domain applications.
  Influence diagnostics are powerful statistical tools to identify influential datapoints
  or subsets of datapoints. We establish finite-sample statistical bounds, as well
  as computational complexity bounds, for influence functions and approximate maximum
  influence perturbations using efficient inverse-Hessian-vector product implementations.
  We illustrate our results with generalized linear models and large attention based
  models on synthetic and real data.
