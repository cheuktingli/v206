title: 'TS-UCB: Improving on Thompson Sampling With Little to No Additional Computation'
software: https://github.com/jwbaek/TS-UCB-Code
abstract: 'Thompson sampling has become a ubiquitous approach to online decision problems
  with bandit feedback. The key algorithmic task for Thompson sampling is drawing
  a sample from the posterior of the optimal action. We propose an alternative arm
  selection rule we dub TS-UCB, that requires negligible additional computational
  effort but provides significant performance improvements relative to Thompson sampling.
  At each step, TS-UCB computes a score for each arm using two ingredients: posterior
  sample(s) and upper confidence bounds. TS-UCB can be used in any setting where these
  two quantities are available, and it is flexible in the number of posterior samples
  it takes as input. TS-UCB achieves materially lower regret on a comprehensive suite
  of synthetic and real-world datasets, including a personalized article recommendation
  dataset from Yahoo! and a suite of benchmark datasets from a deep bandit suite proposed
  in Riquelme et al. (2018). Finally, from a theoretical perspective, we establish
  optimal regret guarantees for TS-UCB for both the K-armed and linear bandit models.'
