title: Who Should Predict? Exact Algorithms For Learning to Defer to Humans
software: https://github.com/clinicalml/human_ai_deferral
abstract: Automated AI classifiers should be able to defer the prediction to a human
  decision maker to ensure more accurate predictions. In this work, we jointly train
  a classifier with a rejector, which decides on each data point whether the classifier
  or the human should predict. We show that prior approaches can fail to find a human-AI
  system with low mis-classification error even when there exists a linear classifier
  and rejector that have zero error (the realizable setting). We prove that obtaining
  a linear pair with low error is NP-hard even when the problem is realizable. To
  complement this negative result, we give a mixed-integer-linear-programming (MILP)
  formulation that can optimally solve the problem in the linear setting. However,
  the MILP only scales to moderately-sized problems. Therefore, we provide a novel
  surrogate loss function that is realizable-consistent and performs well empirically.
  We test our approaches on a comprehensive set of datasets and compare to a wide
  range of baselines.
