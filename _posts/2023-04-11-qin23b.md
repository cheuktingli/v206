title: 'T-Phenotype: Discovering Phenotypes of Predictive Temporal Patterns in Disease
  Progression'
software: https://github.com/vanderschaarlab/tphenotype
abstract: 'Clustering time-series data in healthcare is crucial for clinical phenotyping
  to understand patientsâ€™ disease progression patterns and to design treatment guidelines
  tailored to homogeneous patient subgroups. While rich temporal dynamics enable the
  discovery of potential clusters beyond static correlations, two major challenges
  remain outstanding: i) discovery of predictive patterns from many potential temporal
  correlations in the multi-variate time-series data and ii) association of individual
  temporal patterns to the target label distribution that best characterizes the underlying
  clinical progression. To address such challenges, we develop a novel temporal clustering
  method, T-Phenotype, to discover phenotypes of predictive temporal patterns from
  labeled time-series data. We introduce an efficient representation learning approach
  in frequency domain that can encode variable-length, irregularly-sampled time-series
  into a unified representation space, which is then applied to identify various temporal
  patterns that potentially contribute to the target label using a new notion of path-based
  similarity. Throughout the experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets, we
  show that T-Phenotype achieves the best phenotype discovery performance over all
  the evaluated baselines. We further demonstrate the utility of T-Phenotype by uncovering
  clinically meaningful patient subgroups characterized by unique temporal patterns.'
