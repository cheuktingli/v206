title: Online Learning for Traffic Routing under Unknown Preferences
software: https://github.com/StanfordASL/online-tolls
abstract: In transportation networks, road tolling schemes are a method to cope with
  the efficiency losses due to selfish user routing, wherein users choose routes to
  minimize individual travel costs. However, the efficacy of tolling schemes often
  relies on access to complete information on users’ trip attributes, such as their
  origin-destination (O-D) travel information and their values of time, which may
  not be available in practice. Motivated by this practical consideration, we propose
  an online learning approach to set tolls in a traffic network to drive heterogeneous
  users with different values of time toward a system-efficient traffic pattern. In
  particular, we develop a simple yet effective algorithm that adjusts tolls at each
  time period solely based on the observed aggregate flows on the roads of the network
  without relying on any additional trip attributes of users, thereby preserving user
  privacy. In the setting where the O-D pairs and values of time of users are drawn
  i.i.d. at each period, we show that our approach obtains an expected regret and
  road capacity violation of $O(\sqrt{T})$, where $T$ is the number of periods over
  which tolls are updated. Our regret guarantee is relative to an offline oracle with
  complete information on users’ trip attributes. We further establish a $\Omega(\sqrt{T})$
  lower bound on the regret of any algorithm, which establishes that our algorithm
  is optimal up to constants. Finally, we demonstrate the superior performance of
  our approach relative to several benchmarks on a real-world traffic network, which
  highlights its practical applicability.
