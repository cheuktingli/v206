title: Improved Rate of First Order Algorithms for Entropic Optimal Transport
software: https://github.com/YilingXie27/PDASMD
abstract: This paper improves the state-of-the-art rate of a first-order algorithm
  for solving entropy regularized optimal transport. The resulting rate for approximating
  the optimal transport (OT) has been improved from $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}({n^{2.5}}/{\epsilon})$
  to $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}({n^2}/{\epsilon})$, where $n$ is the problem size and
  $\epsilon$ is the accuracy level. In particular, we propose an accelerated primal-dual
  stochastic mirror descent algorithm with variance reduction. Such special design
  helps us improve the rate compared to other accelerated primal-dual algorithms.
  We further propose a batch version of our stochastic algorithm, which improves the
  computational performance through parallel computing. To compare, we prove that
  the computational complexity of the Stochastic Sinkhorn algorithm is $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}({n^2}/{\epsilon^2})$,
  which is slower than our accelerated primal-dual stochastic mirror algorithm. Experiments
  are done using synthetic and real data, and the results match our theoretical rates.
  Our algorithm may inspire more research to develop accelerated primal-dual algorithms
  that have rate $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}({n^2}/{\epsilon})$ for solving OT.
