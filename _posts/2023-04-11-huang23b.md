title: Towards Balanced Representation Learning for Credit Policy Evaluation
software: https://github.com/yiyhuang3/DRRB_AISTATS2023
abstract: Credit policy evaluation presents profitable opportunities for E-commerce
  platforms through improved decision-making. The core of policy evaluation is estimating
  the causal effects of the policy on the target outcome. However, selection bias
  presents a key challenge in estimating causal effects from real-world data. Some
  recent causal inference methods attempt to mitigate selection bias by leveraging
  covariate balancing in the representation space to obtain the domain-invariant features.
  However, it is noticeable that balanced representation learning can be accompanied
  by a failure of domain discrimination, resulting in the loss of domain-related information.
  This is referred to as the over-balancing issue. In this paper, we introduce a novel
  objective for representation balancing methods to do policy evaluation. In particular,
  we construct a doubly robust loss based on the predictions of treatment and outcomes,
  serving as a prerequisite for covariate balancing to deal with the over-balancing
  issue. In addition, we investigate how to improve treatment effect estimations by
  exploiting the unconfoundedness assumption. The extensive experimental results on
  benchmark datasets and a newly introduced credit dataset show a general outperformance
  of our method compared with existing methods.
