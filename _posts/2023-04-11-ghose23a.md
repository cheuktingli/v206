abstract: Contrastive learning has emerged as a premier method for learning representations
  with or without supervision. Recent studies have shown its utility in graph representation
  learning for pre-training. Despite successes, the understanding of how to design
  effective graph augmentations that can capture structural properties common to many
  different types of downstream graphs remains incomplete. We propose a set of well-motivated
  graph transformation operations derived via graph spectral analysis to provide a
  bank of candidates when constructing augmentations for a graph contrastive objective,
  enabling contrastive learning to capture useful structural representation from pre-training
  graph datasets. We first present a spectral graph cropping augmentation that involves
  filtering nodes by applying thresholds to the eigenvalues of the leading Laplacian
  eigenvectors. Our second novel augmentation reorders the graph frequency components
  in a structural Laplacian-derived position graph embedding. Further, we introduce
  a method that leads to improved views of local subgraphs by performing alignment
  via global random walk embeddings. Our experimental results indicate consistent
  improvements in out-of-domain graph data transfer compared to state-of-the-art graph
  contrastive learning methods, shedding light on how to design a graph learner that
  is able to learn structural properties common to diverse graph types.
