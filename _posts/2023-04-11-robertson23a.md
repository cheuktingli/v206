title: Cooperative Inverse Decision Theory for Uncertain Preferences
software: https://github.com/zrobertson466920/Cooperative-IDT
abstract: Inverse decision theory (IDT) aims to learn a performance metric for classification
  by eliciting expert classifications on examples. However, elicitation in practical
  settings may require many classifications of potentially ambiguous examples. To
  improve the efficiency of elicitation, we propose the cooperative inverse decision
  theory (CIDT) framework as a formalization of the performance metric elicitation
  problem. In cooperative inverse decision theory, the expert and a machine play a
  game where both are rewarded according to the expertâ€™s performance metric, but the
  machine does not initially know what this function is. We show that optimal policies
  in this framework produce active learning that leads to an exponential improvement
  in sample complexity over previous work. One of our key findings is that a broad
  class of sub-optimal experts can be represented as having uncertain preferences.
  We use this finding to show such experts naturally fit into our proposed framework
  extending inverse decision theory to efficiently deal with decision data that is
  sub-optimal due to noise, conflicting experts, or systematic error.
