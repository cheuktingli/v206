title: 'Hedging against Complexity: Distributionally Robust Optimization with Parametric
  Approximation'
abstract: Empirical risk minimization (ERM) and distributionally robust optimization
  (DRO) are popular approaches for solving stochastic optimization problems that appear
  in operations management and machine learning. Existing generalization error bounds
  for these methods depend on either the complexity of the cost function or dimension
  of the uncertain parameters; consequently, the performance of these methods is poor
  for high-dimensional problems with objective functions under high complexity. We
  propose a simple approach in which the distribution of uncertain parameters is approximated
  using a parametric family of distributions. This mitigates both sources of complexity;
  however, it introduces a model misspecification error. We show that this new source
  of error can be controlled by suitable DRO formulations. Our proposed parametric
  DRO approach has significantly improved generalization bounds over existing ERM
  / DRO methods and parametric ERM for a wide variety of settings. Our method is particularly
  effective under distribution shifts. We also illustrate the superior performance
  of our approach on both synthetic and real-data portfolio optimization and regression
  tasks.
