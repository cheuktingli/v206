title: Online Algorithms with Costly Predictions
abstract: In recent years there has been a significant research effort on incorporating
  predictions into online algorithms. However, work in this area often makes the underlying
  assumption that predictions come for free (e.g., without any computational or monetary
  costs). In this paper, we consider a cost associated with making predictions. We
  show that interesting algorithmic subtleties arise for even the most basic online
  problems, such as ski rental and its generalization, the Bahncard problem. In particular,
  we show that with costly predictions, care needs to be taken in (i) asking for the
  prediction at the right time, (ii) deciding if it is worth asking for the prediction,
  and (iii) how many predictions we ask for, in settings where it is natural to consider
  making multiple predictions. Specifically, (i) in the basic ski-rental setting,
  we compute the optimal delay before asking the predictor, (ii) in the same setting,
  given apriori information about the true number of ski-days through its mean and
  variance, we provide a simple algorithm that is near-optimal, under some natural
  parameter settings, in deciding if it is worth asking for the predictor and (iii)
  in the setting of the Bahncard problem, we provide a $(1+\varepsilon)$-approximation
  algorithm and quantify lower bounds on the number of queries required to do so.
  In addition, we show that solving the problem optimally would require almost complete
  information of the instance.
