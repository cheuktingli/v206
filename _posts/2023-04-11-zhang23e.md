title: No-Regret Learning in Two-Echelon Supply Chain with Unknown Demand Distribution
abstract: 'Supply chain management (SCM) has been recognized as an important discipline
  with applications to many industries, where the two-echelon stochastic inventory
  model, involving one downstream retailer and one upstream supplier, plays a fundamental
  role for developing firms’ SCM strategies. In this work, we aim at designing online
  learning algorithms for this problem with an unknown demand distribution, which
  brings distinct features as compared to classic online convex optimization problems.
  Specifically, we consider the two-echelon supply chain model introduced in [Cachon
  and Zipkin, 1999] under two different settings: the centralized setting, where a
  planner decides both agents’ strategy simultaneously, and the decentralized setting,
  where two agents decide their strategy independently and selfishly. We design algorithms
  that achieve favorable guarantees for both regret and convergence to the optimal
  inventory decision in both settings, and additionally for individual regret in the
  decentralized setting. Our algorithms are based on Online Gradient Descent and Online
  Newton Step, together with several new ingredients specifically designed for our
  problem. We also implement our algorithms and show their empirical effectiveness.'
