title: Algorithm-Dependent Bounds for Representation Learning of Multi-Source Domain
  Adaptation
software: https://github.com/livreQ/IMDA
abstract: We use information-theoretic tools to derive a novel analysis of Multi-source
  Domain Adaptation (MDA) from the representation learning perspective. Concretely,
  we study joint distribution alignment for supervised MDA with few target labels
  and unsupervised MDA with pseudo labels, where the latter is relatively hard and
  less commonly studied. We further provide algorithm-dependent generalization bounds
  for these two settings, where the generalization is characterized by the mutual
  information between the parameters and the data. Then we propose a novel deep MDA
  algorithm, implicitly addressing the target shift through joint alignment. Finally,
  the mutual information bounds are extended to this algorithm providing a non-vacuous
  gradient-norm estimation. The proposed algorithm has comparable performance to the
  state-of-the-art on target-shifted MDA benchmark with improved memory efficiency.
