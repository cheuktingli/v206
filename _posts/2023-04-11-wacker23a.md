title: Complex-to-Real Sketches for Tensor Products with Applications to the Polynomial
  Kernel
software: https://github.com/joneswack/dp-rfs
abstract: Randomized sketches of a tensor product of $p$ vectors follow a tradeoff
  between statistical efficiency and computational acceleration. Commonly used approaches
  avoid computing the high-dimensional tensor product explicitly, resulting in a suboptimal
  dependence of $O(3^p)$ in the embedding dimension. We propose a simple Complex-to-Real
  (CtR) modification of well-known sketches that replaces real random projections
  by complex ones, incurring a lower $O(2^p)$ factor in the embedding dimension. The
  output of our sketches is real-valued, which renders their downstream use straightforward.
  In particular, we apply our sketches to $p$-fold self-tensored inputs corresponding
  to the feature maps of the polynomial kernel. We show that our method achieves state-of-the-art
  performance in terms of accuracy and speed compared to other randomized approximations
  from the literature.
