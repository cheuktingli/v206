title: Theoretically Grounded Loss Functions and Algorithms for Adversarial Robustness
abstract: Adversarial robustness is a critical property of classifiers in applications
  as they are increasingly deployed in complex real-world systems. Yet, achieving
  accurate adversarial robustness in machine learning remains a persistent challenge
  and the choice of the surrogate loss function used for training a key factor. We
  present a family of new loss functions for adversarial robustness, smooth adversarial
  losses, which we show can be derived in a general way from broad families of loss
  functions used in multi-class classification. We prove strong H-consistency theoretical
  guarantees for these loss functions, including multi-class H-consistency bounds
  for sum losses in the adversarial setting. We design new regularized algorithms
  based on the minimization of these principled smooth adversarial losses (PSAL).
  We further show through a series of extensive experiments with the CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100
  and SVHN datasets that our PSAL algorithm consistently outperforms the current state-of-the-art
  technique, TRADES, for both robust accuracy against l-infinity-norm bounded perturbations
  and, even more significantly, for clean accuracy. Finally, we prove that, unlike
  PSAL, the TRADES loss in general does not admit an H-consistency property.
