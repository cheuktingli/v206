title: Bayesian Hierarchical Models for Counterfactual Estimation
abstract: Counterfactual explanations utilize feature perturbations to analyze the
  outcome of an original decision and recommend an actionable recourse. We argue that
  it is beneficial to provide several alternative explanations rather than a single
  point solution and propose a probabilistic paradigm to estimate a diverse set of
  counterfactuals. Specifically, we treat the perturbations as random variables endowed
  with prior distribution functions. This allows sampling multiple counterfactuals
  from the posterior density, with the added benefit of incorporating inductive biases,
  preserving domain specific constraints and quantifying uncertainty in estimates.
  More importantly, we leverage Bayesian hierarchical modeling to share information
  across different subgroups of a population, which can both improve robustness and
  measure fairness. A gradient based sampler with superior convergence characteristics
  efficiently computes the posterior samples. Experiments across several datasets
  demonstrate that the counterfactuals estimated using our approach are valid, sparse,
  diverse and feasible.
