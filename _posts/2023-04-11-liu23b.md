title: Sparse Bayesian optimization
software: https://github.com/facebookresearch/SparseBO
abstract: Bayesian optimization (BO) is a powerful approach to sample-efficient optimization
  of black-box objective functions. However, the application of BO to areas such as
  recommendation systems often requires taking the interpretability and simplicity
  of the configurations into consideration, a setting that has not been previously
  studied in the BO literature. To make BO applicable in this setting, we present
  several regularization-based approaches that allow us to discover sparse and more
  interpretable configurations. We propose a novel differentiable relaxation based
  on homotopy continuation that makes it possible to target sparsity by working directly
  with $L_0$ regularization. We identify failure modes for regularized BO and develop
  a hyperparameter-free method, sparsity exploring Bayesian optimization (SEBO) that
  seeks to simultaneously maximize a target objective and sparsity. SEBO and methods
  based on fixed regularization are evaluated on synthetic and real-world problems,
  and we show that we are able to efficiently optimize for sparsity.
