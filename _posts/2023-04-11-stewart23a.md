title: 'Regression as Classification: Influence of Task Formulation on Neural Network
  Features'
software: https://github.com/LawrenceMMStewart/Regression-as-Classification
abstract: Neural networks can be trained to solve regression problems by using gradient-based
  methods to minimize the square loss. However, practitioners often prefer to reformulate
  regression as a classification problem, observing that training on the cross entropy
  loss results in better performance. By focusing on two-layer ReLU networks, which
  can be fully characterized by measures over their feature space, we explore how
  the implicit bias induced by gradient-based optimization could partly explain the
  above phenomenon. We provide theoretical evidence that the regression formulation
  yields a measure whose support can differ greatly from that for classification,
  in the case of one-dimensional data. Our proposed optimal supports correspond directly
  to the features learned by the input layer of the network. The different nature
  of these supports sheds light on possible optimization difficulties the square loss
  could encounter during training, and we present empirical results illustrating this
  phenomenon.
