title: Autoencoded sparse Bayesian in-IRT factorization, calibration, and amortized
  inference for the Work Disability Functional Assessment Battery
software: https://github.com/CC-RMD-EpiBio/autoencirt
abstract: 'The Work Disability Functional Assessment Battery (WD-FAB) is a multidimensional
  item response theory (IRT) instrument designed for assessing work-related mental
  and physical function based on responses to an item bank. In prior iterations it
  was developed using traditional means – linear factorization and null hypothesis
  statistical testing for item partitioning/selection, and finally, posthoc calibration
  of disjoint unidimensional IRT models. As a result, the WD-FAB, like many other
  IRT instruments, is a posthoc model. Its item partitioning, based on exploratory
  factor analysis, is blind to the final nonlinear IRT model and is not performed
  in a manner consistent with goodness of fit to the final model. In this manuscript,
  we develop a Bayesian hierarchical model for self-consistently performing the following
  simultaneous tasks: scale factorization, item selection, parameter identification,
  and response scoring. This method uses sparsity-based shrinkage to obviate the linear
  factorization and null hypothesis statistical tests that are usually required for
  developing multidimensional IRT models, so that item partitioning is consistent
  with the ultimate nonlinear factor model. We also analogize our multidimensional
  IRT model to probabilistic autoencoders, specifying an encoder function that amortizes
  the inference of ability parameters from item responses. The encoder function is
  equivalent to the “VBE” step in a stochastic variational Bayesian expectation maximization
  (VBEM) procedure that we use for approximate Bayesian inference on the entire model.
  We use the method on a sample of WD-FAB item responses and compare the resulting
  item discriminations to those obtained using the traditional posthoc method.'
