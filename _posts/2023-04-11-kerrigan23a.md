title: Diffusion Generative Models in Infinite Dimensions
software: https://github.com/GavinKerrigan/functional_diffusion
abstract: Diffusion generative models have recently been applied to domains where
  the available data can be seen as a discretization of an underlying function, such
  as audio signals or time series. However, these models operate directly on the discretized
  data, and there are no semantics in the modeling process that relate the observed
  data to the underlying functional forms. We generalize diffusion models to operate
  directly in function space by developing the foundational theory for such models
  in terms of Gaussian measures on Hilbert spaces. A significant benefit of our function
  space point of view is that it allows us to explicitly specify the space of functions
  we are working in, leading us to develop methods for diffusion generative modeling
  in Sobolev spaces. Our approach allows us to perform both unconditional and conditional
  generation of function-valued data. We demonstrate our methods on several synthetic
  and real-world benchmarks.
