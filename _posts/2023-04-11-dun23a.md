title: Efficient and Light-Weight Federated Learning via Asynchronous Distributed
  Dropout
software: https://github.com/dunchen/AsyncDrop__Release
abstract: Asynchronous learning protocols have regained attention lately, especially
  in the Federated Learning (FL) setup, where slower clients can severely impede the
  learning process. Herein, we propose AsyncDrop, a novel asynchronous FL framework
  that utilizes dropout regularization to handle device heterogeneity in distributed
  settings. Overall, AsyncDrop achieves better performance compared to state of the
  art asynchronous methodologies, while resulting in less communication and training
  time overheads. The key idea revolves around creating “submodels” out of the global
  model, and distributing their training to workers, based on device heterogeneity.
  We rigorously justify that such an approach can be theoretically characterized.
  We implement our approach and compare it against other asynchronous baselines, both
  by design and by adapting existing synchronous FL algorithms to asynchronous scenarios.
  Empirically, AsyncDrop reduces the communication cost and training time, while matching
  or improving the final test accuracy in diverse non-i.i.d. FL scenarios.
