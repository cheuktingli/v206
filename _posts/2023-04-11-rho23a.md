title: Differentially Private Synthetic Control
software: https://github.com/srho1/dpsc.git
abstract: Synthetic control is a causal inference tool used to estimate the treatment
  effects of an intervention by creating synthetic counterfactual data. This approach
  combines measurements from other similar observations (i.e., donor pool) to predict
  a counterfactual time series of interest (i.e., target unit) by analyzing the relationship
  between the target and the donor pool before the intervention. As synthetic control
  tools are increasingly applied to sensitive or proprietary data, formal privacy
  protections are often required. In this work, we suggest the first algorithms for
  differentially private synthetic control with explicit error bounds based on the
  analysis of the sensitivity of the synthetic control query. Our approach builds
  upon tools from non-private synthetic control and differentially private empirical
  risk minimization. We empirically evaluate the performance of our algorithms and
  show favorable results in a variety of parameter regimes.
