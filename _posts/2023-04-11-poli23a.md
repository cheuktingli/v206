title: Ideal Abstractions for Decision-Focused Learning
abstract: 'We present a methodology for formulating simplifying abstractions in machine
  learning systems by identifying and harnessing the utility structure of decisions.
  Machine learning tasks commonly involve high-dimensional output spaces (e.g., predictions
  for every pixel in an image or node in a graph), even though a coarser output would
  often suffice for downstream decision-making (e.g., regions of an image instead
  of pixels). Developers often hand-engineer abstractions of the output space, but
  numerous abstractions are possible and it is unclear how the choice of output space
  for a model impacts its usefulness in downstream decision-making. We propose a method
  that configures the output space automatically in order to minimize the loss of
  decision-relevant information. Taking a geometric perspective, we formulate a step
  of the algorithm as a projection of the probability simplex, termed fold, that minimizes
  the total loss of decision-related information in the H-entropy sense. Crucially,
  learning in the abstracted outcome space requires significantly less data, leading
  to a net improvement in decision quality. We demonstrate the method in two domains:
  data acquisition for deep neural network training and a closed-loop wildfire management
  task.'
