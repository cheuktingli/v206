title: Statistical Analysis of Karcher Means for Random Restricted PSD Matrices
abstract: Non-asymptotic statistical analysis is often missing for modern geometry-aware
  machine learning algorithms due to the possibly intricate non-linear manifold structure.
  This paper studies an intrinsic mean model on the manifold of restricted positive
  semi-definite matrices and provides a non-asymptotic statistical analysis of the
  Karcher mean. We also consider a general extrinsic signal-plus-noise model, under
  which a deterministic error bound of the Karcher mean is provided. As an application,
  we show that the distributed principal component analysis algorithm, LRC-dPCA, achieves
  the same performance as the full sample PCA algorithm. Numerical experiments lend
  strong support to our theories.
