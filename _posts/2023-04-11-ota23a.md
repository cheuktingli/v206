title: Learning with Partial Forgetting in Modern Hopfield Networks
software: https://github.com/Toshihiro-Ota/lwpf
abstract: It has been known by neuroscience studies that partial and transient forgetting
  of memory often plays an important role in the brain to improve performance for
  certain intellectual activities. In machine learning, associative memory models
  such as classical and modern Hopfield networks have been proposed to express memories
  as attractors in the feature space of a closed recurrent network. In this work,
  we propose learning with partial forgetting (LwPF), where a partial forgetting functionality
  is designed by element-wise non-bijective projections, for memory neurons in modern
  Hopfield networks to improve model performance. We incorporate LwPF into the attention
  mechanism also, whose process has been shown to be identical to the update rule
  of a certain modern Hopfield network, by modifying the corresponding Lagrangian.
  We evaluated the effectiveness of LwPF on three diverse tasks such as bit-pattern
  classification, immune repertoire classification for computational biology, and
  image classification for computer vision, and confirmed that LwPF consistently improves
  the performance of existing neural networks including DeepRC and vision transformers.
