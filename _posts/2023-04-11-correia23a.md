title: Neural Simulated Annealing
abstract: 'Simulated annealing (SA) is a stochastic global optimisation metaheuristic
  applicable to a wide range of discrete and continuous variable problems. Despite
  its simplicity, SA hinges on carefully handpicked components, viz. proposal distribution
  and annealing schedule, that often have to be fine tuned to individual problem instances.
  In this work, we seek to make SA more effective and easier to use by framing its
  proposal distribution as a reinforcement learning policy that can be optimised for
  higher solution quality given a computational budget. The result is Neural SA, a
  competitive and general machine learning method for combinatorial optimisation that
  is efficient, and easy to design and train. We show Neural SA with such a learnt
  proposal distribution, parametrised by small equivariant neural networks, outperforms
  SA baselines on several problems: Rosenbrockâ€™s function and the Knapsack, Bin Packing
  and Travelling Salesperson problems. We also show Neural SA scales well to large
  problems (generalising to much larger instances than those seen during training)
  while getting comparable performance to popular off-the-shelf solvers and machine
  learning methods in terms of solution quality and wall-clock time.'
