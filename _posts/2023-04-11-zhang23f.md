title: 'Online Learning for Non-monotone DR-Submodular Maximization: From Full Information
  to Bandit Feedback'
abstract: In this paper, we revisit the online non-monotone continuous DR-submodular
  maximization problem over a down-closed convex set, which finds wide real-world
  applications in the domain of machine learning, economics, and operations research.
  At first, we present the Meta-MFW algorithm achieving a $1/e$-regret of $O(\sqrt{T})$
  at the cost of $T^{3/2}$ stochastic gradient evaluations per round. As far as we
  know, Meta-MFW is the first algorithm to obtain $1/e$-regret of $O(\sqrt{T})$ for
  the online non-monotone continuous DR-submodular maximization problem over a down-closed
  convex set. Furthermore, in sharp contrast with ODC algorithm (Thang $&$ Srivastav,
  2021), Meta-MFW relies on the simple online linear oracle without discretization,
  lifting, or rounding operations. Considering the practical restrictions, we then
  propose the Mono-MFW algorithm, which reduces the per-function stochastic gradient
  evaluations from $T^{3/2}$ to 1 and achieves a $1/e$-regret bound of $O(T^{4/5})$.
  Next, we extend Mono-MFW to the bandit setting and propose the Bandit-MFW algorithm
  which attains a $1/e$-regret bound of $O(T^{8/9})$. To the best of our knowledge,
  Mono-MFW and Bandit-MFW are the first sublinear-regret algorithms to explore the
  one-shot and bandit setting for online non-monotone continuous DR-submodular maximization
  problem over a down-closed convex set, respectively. Finally, we conduct numerical
  experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets to verify the effectiveness
  of our methods.
