abstract: We present Parallel Feasible Pareto Frontier Entropy Search ($\{\mathrm{PF}\}^2$ES)
  — a novel information-theoretic acquisition function for multi-objective Bayesian
  optimization supporting unknown constraints and batch queries. Due to the complexity
  of characterizing the mutual information between candidate evaluations and (feasible)
  Pareto frontiers, existing approaches must either employ crude approximations that
  significantly hamper their performance or rely on expensive inference schemes that
  substantially increase the optimization’s computational overhead. By instead using
  a variational lower bound, $\{\mathrm{PF}\}^2$ES provides a low-cost and accurate
  estimate of the mutual information. We benchmark $\{\mathrm{PF}\}^2$ES against other
  information-theoretic acquisition functions, demonstrating its competitive performance
  for optimization across synthetic and real-world design problems.
