title: A Constant-Factor Approximation Algorithm for Reconciliation $k$-Median
abstract: In the reconciliation $k$-median problem we ask to cluster a set of data
  points by picking $k$ cluster centers so as to minimize the sum of distances of
  the data points to their cluster centers plus the sum of pairwise distances between
  the centers. The problem, which is a variant of classic $k$-median, aims to find
  a set of cluster centers that are not too far from each other, and it has applications,
  or example, when selecting a committee to deliberate on a controversial topic. This
  problem was introduced recently (Ordozgoiti et al., 2019), and it was shown that
  a local-search-based algorithm is always within a factor $O(k)$ of an optimum solution
  and performs well in practice. In this paper, we demonstrate a close connection
  of reconciliation $k$-median to a variant of the $k$-facility location problem,
  in which each potential cluster center has an individual opening cost and we aim
  at minimizing the sum of client-center distances and the opening costs. This connection
  enables us to provide a new algorithm for reconciliation $k$-median that yields
  a constant-factor approximation (independent of $k$). We also provide a sparsification
  scheme that reduces the number of potential cluster centers to $O(k)$ in order to
  substantially speed up approximation algorithms. We empirically compare our new
  algorithms with the previous local-search approach, showing improved performance
  and stability. In addition, we show how our sparsification approach helps to reduce
  computation time without significantly compromising the solution quality.
