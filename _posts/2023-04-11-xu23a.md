title: Finding Regularized Competitive Equilibria of Heterogeneous Agent Macroeconomic
  Models via Reinforcement Learning
abstract: We study a heterogeneous agent macroeconomic model with an infinite number
  of households and firms competing in a labor market. Each household earns income
  and engages in consumption at each time step while aiming to maximize a concave
  utility subject to the underlying market conditions. The households aim to find
  the optimal saving strategy that maximizes their discounted cumulative utility given
  the market condition, while the firms determine the market conditions through maximizing
  corporate profit based on the household population behavior. The model captures
  a wide range of applications in macroeconomic studies, and we propose a data-driven
  reinforcement learning framework that finds the regularized competitive equilibrium
  of the model. The proposed algorithm enjoys theoretical guarantees in converging
  to the equilibrium of the market at a sub-linear rate.
