title: On the Privacy Risks of Algorithmic Recourse
software: https://github.com/MartinPawel
abstract: As predictive models are increasingly being employed to make consequential
  decisions, there is a growing emphasis on developing techniques that can provide
  algorithmic recourse to affected individuals. While such recourses can be immensely
  beneficial to affected individuals, potential adversaries could also exploit these
  recourses to compromise privacy. In this work, we make the first attempt at investigating
  if and how an adversary can leverage recourses to infer private information about
  the underlying modelâ€™s training data. To this end, we propose a series of novel
  membership inference attacks which leverage algorithmic recourse. More specifically,
  we extend the prior literature on membership inference attacks to the recourse setting
  by leveraging the distances between data instances and their corresponding counterfactuals
  output by state-of-the-art recourse methods. Extensive experimentation with real
  world and synthetic datasets demonstrates significant privacy leakage through recourses.
  Our work establishes unintended privacy leakage as an important risk in the widespread
  adoption of recourse methods.
