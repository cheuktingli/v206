title: 'Indeterminacy in Generative Models: Characterization and Strong Identifiability'
abstract: Most modern probabilistic generative models, such as the variational autoencoder
  (VAE), have certain indeterminacies that are unresolvable even with an infinite
  amount of data. Different tasks tolerate different indeterminacies, however recent
  applications have indicated the need for strongly identifiable models, in which
  an observation corresponds to a unique latent code. Progress has been made towards
  reducing model indeterminacies while maintaining flexibility, and recent work excludes
  many—but not all—indeterminacies. In this work, we motivate model-identifiability
  in terms of task-identifiability, then construct a theoretical framework for analyzing
  the indeterminacies of latent variable models, which enables their precise characterization
  in terms of the generator function and prior distribution spaces. We reveal that
  strong identifiability is possible even with highly flexible nonlinear generators,
  and give two such examples. One is a straightforward modification of iVAE (Khemakhem
  et al., 2020); the other uses triangular monotonic maps, leading to novel connections
  between optimal transport and identifiability.
