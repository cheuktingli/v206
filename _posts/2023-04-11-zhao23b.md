title: 'Automatic Attention Pruning: Improving and Automating Model Pruning using
  Attentions'
software: https://github.com/kaiqi123/Automatic-Attention-Pruning.git
abstract: 'Pruning is a promising approach to compress deep learning models in order
  to deploy them on resource-constrained edge devices. However, many existing pruning
  solutions are based on unstructured pruning, which yields models that cannot efficiently
  run on commodity hardware; and they often require users to manually explore and
  tune the pruning process, which is time-consuming and often leads to sub-optimal
  results. To address these limitations, this paper presents Automatic Attention Pruning
  (AAP), an adaptive, attention-based, structured pruning approach to automatically
  generate small, accurate, and hardware-efficient models that meet user objectives.
  First, it proposes iterative structured pruning using activation-based attention
  maps to effectively identify and prune unimportant filters. Then, it proposes adaptive
  pruning policies for automatically meeting the pruning objectives of accuracy-critical,
  memory-constrained, and latency-sensitive tasks. A comprehensive evaluation shows
  that AAP substantially outperforms the state-of-the-art structured pruning works
  for a variety of model architectures. Our code is at: https://github.com/kaiqi123/Automatic-Attention-Pruning.git.'
