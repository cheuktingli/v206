title: 'Squeeze All: Novel Estimator and Self-Normalized Bound for Linear Contextual
  Bandits'
abstract: We propose a linear contextual bandit algorithm for linear contextual bandits
  with $O(\sqrt{dT \log T})$ regret bound, where $d$ is the dimension of contexts
  and $T$ is the time horizon. Our proposed algorithm is equipped with a novel estimator
  in which exploration is embedded through explicit randomization. Depending on the
  randomization, our proposed estimator takes contribution either from contexts of
  all arms or from selected contexts. We establish a self-normalized bound for our
  estimator, which allows a novel decomposition of the cumulative regret into additive
  dimension-dependent terms instead of multiplicative terms. We also prove a novel
  lower bound of $\Omega(\sqrt{dT})$ under our problem setting. Hence, the regret
  of our proposed algorithm matches the lower bound up to logarithmic factors. The
  numerical experiments support the theoretical guarantees and show that our proposed
  method outperforms the existing linear bandit algorithms.
