title: Sparse Spectral Bayesian Permanental Process with Generalized Kernel
software: https://github.com/jesellier/GSSPP
abstract: We introduce a novel scheme for Bayesian inference on permanental processes
  which models the Poisson intensity as the square of a Gaussian process. Combining
  generalized kernels and a Fourier features-based representation of the Gaussian
  process with a Laplace approximation to the posterior, we achieve a fast and efficient
  inference that does not require numerical integration over the input space, allows
  kernel design and scales linearly with the number of events. Our method builds and
  improves upon the state-of-theart Laplace Bayesian point process benchmark of Walder
  and Bishop (2017), demonstrated on both synthetic, real-world temporal and large
  spatial data sets.
