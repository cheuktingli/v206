title: Adapting to Latent Subgroup Shifts via Concepts and Proxies
software: https://github.com/google-research/google-research/tree/master/latent_shift_adaptation
abstract: We address the problem of unsupervised domain adaptation when the source
  domain differs from the target domain because of a shift in the distribution of
  a latent subgroup. When this subgroup confounds all observed data, neither covariate
  shift nor label shift assumptions apply. We show that the optimal target predictor
  can be non-parametrically identified with the help of concept and proxy variables
  available only in the source domain, and unlabeled data from the target. The identification
  results are constructive, immediately suggesting an algorithm for estimating the
  optimal predictor in the target. For continuous observations, when this algorithm
  becomes impractical, we propose a latent variable model specific to the data generation
  process at hand. We show how the approach degrades as the size of the shift changes,
  and verify that it outperforms both covariate and label shift adjustment.
