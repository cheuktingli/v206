title: Scalable Bicriteria Algorithms for Non-Monotone Submodular Cover
abstract: In this paper, we consider the optimization problem Submodular Cover (SC),
  which is to find a minimum cost subset of a ground set $U$ such that the value of
  a submodular function $f$ is above a threshold $\tau$. In contrast to most existing
  work on SC, it is not assumed that $f$ is monotone. Two bicriteria approximation
  algorithms are presented for SC that, for input parameter $0 < \epsilon < 1$, give
  $O( 1 / \epsilon^2 )$ ratio to the optimal cost and ensures the function $f$ is
  at least $\tau(1 - \epsilon)/2$. A lower bound shows that under the value query
  model shows that no polynomial-time algorithm can ensure that $f$ is larger than
  $\tau/2$. Further, the algorithms presented are scalable to large data sets, processing
  the ground set in a stream. Similar algorithms developed for SC also work for the
  related optimization problem of Submodular Maximization (KCSM). Finally, the algorithms
  are demonstrated to be effective in experiments involving graph cut and data summarization
  functions.
