title: 'Probabilities of Causation: Role of Observational Data'
abstract: Probabilities of causation play a crucial role in modern decision-making.
  Pearl defined three binary probabilities of causation, the probability of necessity
  and sufficiency (PNS), the probability of sufficiency (PS), and the probability
  of necessity (PN). These probabilities were then bounded by Tian and Pearl using
  a combination of experimental and observational data. However, observational data
  are not always available in practice; in such a case, Tian and Pearlâ€™s Theorem provided
  valid but less effective bounds using pure experimental data. In this paper, we
  discuss the conditions that observational data are worth considering to improve
  the quality of the bounds. More specifically, we defined the expected improvement
  of the bounds by assuming the observational distributions are uniformly distributed
  on their feasible interval. We further applied the proposed theorems to the unit
  selection problem defined by Li and Pearl.
