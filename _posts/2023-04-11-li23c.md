title: Meta-Learning with Adjoint Methods
software: https://github.com/shib0li/Adjoint-MAML
abstract: Model Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) is widely used to find a good initialization
  for a family of tasks. Despite its success, a critical challenge in MAML is to calculate
  the gradient w.r.t. the initialization of a long training trajectory for the sampled
  tasks, because the computation graph can rapidly explode and the computational cost
  is very expensive. To address this problem, we propose Adjoint MAML (A-MAML). We
  view gradient descent in the inner optimization as the evolution of an Ordinary
  Differential Equation (ODE). To efficiently compute the gradient of the validation
  loss w.r.t. the initialization, we use the adjoint method to construct a companion,
  backward ODE. To obtain the gradient w.r.t. the initialization, we only need to
  run the standard ODE solver twice â€” one is forward in time that evolves a long trajectory
  of gradient flow for the sampled task; the other is backward and solves the adjoint
  ODE. We need not create or expand any intermediate computational graphs, adopt aggressive
  approximations, or impose proximal regularizers in the training loss. Our approach
  is cheap, accurate, and adaptable to different trajectory lengths. We demonstrate
  the advantage of our approach in both synthetic and real-world meta-learning tasks.
