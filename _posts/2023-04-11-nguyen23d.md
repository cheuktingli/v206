title: Nonmyopic Multiclass Active Search with Diminishing Returns for Diverse Discovery
software: https://github.com/KrisNguyen135/diverse_as
abstract: Active search is a setting in adaptive experimental design where we aim
  to uncover members of rare, valuable class(es) subject to a budget constraint. An
  important consideration in this problem is diversity among the discovered targets
  â€“ in many applications, diverse discoveries offer more insight and may be preferable
  in downstream tasks. However, most existing active search policies either assume
  that all targets belong to a common positive class or encourage diversity via simple
  heuristics. We present a novel formulation of active search with multiple target
  classes, characterized by a utility function chosen from a flexible family whose
  members encourage diversity among discoveries via a diminishing returns mechanism.
  We then study this problem under the Bayesian lens and prove a hardness result for
  approximating the optimal policy for arbitrary positive, increasing, and concave
  utility functions. Finally, we design an efficient, nonmyopic approximation to the
  optimal policy for this class of utilities and demonstrate its superior empirical
  performance in a variety of experimental settings, including drug discovery.
