title: 'HeteRSGD: Tackling Heterogeneous Sampling Costs via Optimal Reweighted Stochastic
  Gradient Descent'
abstract: One implicit assumption in current stochastic gradient descent (SGD) algorithms
  is the identical cost for sampling each component function of the finite-sum objective.
  However, there are applications where the costs differ substantially, for which
  SGD schemes with uniform sampling invoke a high sampling load. We investigate the
  use of importance sampling (IS) as a cost saver in this setting, in contrast to
  its traditional use for variance reduction. The key ingredient is a novel efficiency
  metric for IS that advocates low sampling costs while penalizing high gradient variances.
  We then propose HeteRSGD, an SGD scheme that performs gradient sampling according
  to optimal probability weights stipulated by the metric, and establish theories
  on its optimal asymptotic and finite-time convergence rates among all possible IS-based
  SGD schemes. We show that the relative efficiency gain of HeteRSGD can be arbitrarily
  large regardless of the problem dimension and number of components. Our theoretical
  results are validated numerically for both convex and nonconvex problems.
