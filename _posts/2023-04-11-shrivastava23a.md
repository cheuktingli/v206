abstract: 'We propose CLIP-Lite, an information efficient method for visual representation
  learning by feature alignment with textual annotations. Compared to the previously
  proposed CLIP model, CLIP-Lite requires only one negative image-text sample pair
  for every positive image-text sample during the optimization of its contrastive
  learning objective. We accomplish this by taking advantage of an information efficient
  lower-bound to maximize the mutual information between the two input modalities.
  This allows CLIP-Lite to be trained with significantly reduced amounts of data and
  batch sizes while obtaining better performance than CLIP at the same scale. We evaluate
  CLIP-Lite by pretraining on the COCO-Captions dataset and testing transfer learning
  to other datasets. CLIP-Lite obtains a +14.0$%$ mAP absolute gain in performance
  on Pascal VOC classification, and a +22.1$%$ top-1 accuracy gain on ImageNet, while
  being comparable or superior to other, more complex, text-supervised models. CLIP-Lite
  is also superior to CLIP on image and text retrieval, zero-shot classification,
  and visual grounding. Finally, we show that CLIP-Lite can leverage language semantics
  to encourage bias-free visual representations that can be used in downstream tasks.
