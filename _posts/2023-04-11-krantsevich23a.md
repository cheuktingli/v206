title: Stochastic Tree Ensembles for Estimating Heterogeneous Effects
software: https://github.com/JingyuHe/bcf2
abstract: Determining subgroups that respond especially well (or poorly) to specific
  interventions (medical or policy) requires new supervised learning methods tailored
  specifically for causal inference. Bayesian Causal Forest (BCF) is a recent method
  that has been documented to perform well on data generating processes with strong
  confounding of the sort that is plausible in many applications. This paper develops
  a novel algorithm for fitting the BCF model, which is more efficient than the previous
  Gibbs sampler. The new algorithm can be used to initialize independent chains of
  the existing Gibbs sampler leading to better posterior exploration and coverage
  of the associated interval estimates in simulation studies. The new algorithm is
  compared to related approaches via simulation studies as well as an empirical analysis.
