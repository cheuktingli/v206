title: A Variance-Reduced and Stabilized Proximal Stochastic Gradient Method with
  Support Identification Guarantees for Structured Optimization
software: https://github.com/Yutong-Dai/S-PStorm
abstract: This paper introduces a new proximal stochastic gradient method with variance
  reduction and stabilization for minimizing the sum of a convex stochastic function
  and a group sparsity-inducing regularization function. Since the method may be viewed
  as a stabilized version of the recently proposed algorithm PStorm, we call our algorithm
  S-PStorm. Our analysis shows that S-PStorm has strong convergence results. In particular,
  we prove an upper bound on the number of iterations required by S-PStorm before
  its iterates correctly identify (with high probability) an optimal support (i.e.,
  the zero and nonzero structure of an optimal solution). Most algorithms in the literature
  with such a support identification property use variance reduction techniques that
  require either periodically evaluating an exact gradient or storing a history of
  stochastic gradients. Unlike these methods, S-PStorm achieves variance reduction
  without requiring either of these, which is advantageous. Moreover, our support-identification
  result for S-PStorm shows that, with high probability, an optimal support will be
  identified correctly in all iterations with index above a threshold. We believe
  that this type of result is new to the literature since the few existing other results
  prove that the optimal support is identified with high probability at each iteration
  with a sufficiently large index (meaning that the optimal support might be identified
  in some iterations, but not in others). Numerical experiments on regularized logistic
  loss problems show that S-PStorm outperforms existing methods in various metrics
  that measure how efficiently and robustly iterates of an algorithm identify an optimal
  support.
