title: Manifold Restricted Interventional Shapley Values
software: https://github.com/amazon-science/manifold-restricted-shapley
abstract: Shapley values are model-agnostic methods for explaining model predictions.
  Many commonly used methods of computing Shapley values, known as off-manifold methods,
  rely on model evaluations on out-of-distribution input samples. Consequently, explanations
  obtained are sensitive to model behaviour outside the data distribution, which may
  be irrelevant for all practical purposes. While on-manifold methods have been proposed
  which do not suffer from this problem, we show that such methods are overly dependent
  on the input data distribution, and therefore result in unintuitive and misleading
  explanations. To circumvent these problems, we propose ManifoldShap, which respects
  the model’s domain of validity by restricting model evaluations to the data manifold.
  We show, theoretically and empirically, that ManifoldShap is robust to off-manifold
  perturbations of the model and leads to more accurate and intuitive explanations
  than existing state-of-the-art Shapley methods.
