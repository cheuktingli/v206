title: Mean Parity Fair Regression in RKHS
software: https://github.com/shawkui/MP_Fair_Regression
abstract: We study the fair regression problem under the notion of Mean Parity (MP)
  fairness, which requires the conditional mean of the learned function output to
  be constant with respect to the sensitive attributes. We address this problem by
  leveraging reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) to construct the functional space
  whose members are guaranteed to satisfy the fairness constraints. The proposed functional
  space suggests a closed-form solution for the fair regression problem that is naturally
  compatible with multiple sensitive attributes. Furthermore, by formulating the fairness-accuracy
  tradeoff as a relaxed fair regression problem, we derive a corresponding regression
  function that can be implemented efficiently and provides interpretable tradeoffs.
  More importantly, under some mild assumptions, the proposed method can be applied
  to regression problems with a covariance-based notion of fairness. Experimental
  results on benchmark datasets show the proposed methods achieve competitive and
  even superior performance compared with several state-of-the-art methods.
