title: An Unpooling Layer for Graph Generation
software: https://github.com/guo00413/graph_unpooling
abstract: We propose a novel and trainable graph unpooling layer for effective graph
  generation. The unpooling layer receives an input graph with features and outputs
  an enlarged graph with desired structure and features. We prove that the output
  graph of the unpooling layer remains connected and for any connected graph there
  exists a series of unpooling layers that can produce it from a 3-node graph. We
  apply the unpooling layer within the generator of a generative adversarial network
  as well as the decoder of a variational autoencoder. We give extensive experimental
  evidence demonstrating the competitive performance of our proposed method on synthetic
  and real data.
