title: Differentially Private Matrix Completion through Low-rank Matrix Factorization
abstract: We study the matrix completion problem under joint differential privacy
  and develop a non-convex low-rank matrix factorization-based method for solving
  it. Our method comes with strong privacy and utility guarantees, has a linear convergence
  rate, and is more scalable than the best-known alternative (Chien et al., 2021).
  Our method achieves the (near) optimal sample complexity for matrix completion required
  by the non-private baseline and is much better than the best known result under
  joint differential privacy. Furthermore, we prove a tight utility guarantee that
  improves existing approaches and removes the impractical resampling assumption used
  in the literature. Numerical experiments further demonstrate the superiority of
  our method.
