title: Discovering Many Diverse Solutions with Bayesian Optimization
software: https://github.com/nataliemaus/robot
abstract: Bayesian optimization (BO) is a popular approach for sample-efficient optimization
  of black-box objective functions. While BO has been successfully applied to a wide
  range of scientific applications, traditional approaches to single-objective BO
  only seek to find a single best solution. This can be a significant limitation in
  situations where solutions may later turn out to be intractable, for example, a
  designed molecule may turn out to later violate constraints that can only be evaluated
  after the optimization process has concluded. To address this issue, we propose
  rank-ordered Bayesian Optimization with trustregions (ROBOT) which aims to find
  a portfolio of high-performing solutions that are diverse according to a user-specified
  diversity measure. We evaluate ROBOT on several real-world applications and show
  that it can discover large sets of high-performing diverse solutions while requiring
  few additional function evaluations compared to finding a single best solution.
