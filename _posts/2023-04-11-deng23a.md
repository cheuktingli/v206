title: Reinforcement Learning with Stepwise Fairness Constraints
abstract: AI methods are used in societally important settings, ranging from credit
  to employment to housing, and it is crucial to provide fairness in regard to automated
  decision making. Moreover, many settings are dynamic, with populations responding
  to sequential decision policies. We introduce the study of reinforcement learning
  (RL) with stepwise fairness constraints, which require group fairness at each time
  step. In the case of tabular episodic RL, we provide learning algorithms with strong
  theoretical guarantees in regard to policy optimality and fairness violations. Our
  framework provides tools to study the impact of fairness constraints in sequential
  settings and brings up new challenges in RL.
