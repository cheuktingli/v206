title: Improved Approximation for Fair Correlation Clustering
software: https://github.com/moonin12/improved_fair_correlation_clustering/tree/main/lp_res_color_dist
abstract: Correlation clustering is a ubiquitous paradigm in unsupervised machine
  learning where addressing unfairness is a major challenge. Motivated by this, we
  study fair correlation clustering where the data points may belong to different
  protected groups and the goal is to ensure fair representation of all groups across
  clusters. Our paper significantly generalizes and improves on the quality guarantees
  of previous work of Ahmadian et al. as follows. * We allow the user to specify an
  arbitrary upper bound on the representation of each group in a cluster. * Our algorithm
  allows individuals to have multiple protected features and ensure fairness simultaneously
  across them all. * We prove guarantees for clustering quality and fairness in this
  general setting. Furthermore, this improves on the results for the special cases
  studied in previous work. Our experiments on real-world data demonstrate that our
  clustering quality compared to the optimal solution is much better than what our
  theoretical result suggests.
