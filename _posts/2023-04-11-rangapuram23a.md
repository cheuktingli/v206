title: Coherent Probabilistic Forecasting of Temporal Hierarchies
software: https://github.com/awslabs/gluonts/tree/dev/src/gluonts/nursery/temporal_hierarchical_forecasting
abstract: Forecasts at different time granularities are required in practice for addressing
  various business problems starting from short-term operational to medium-term tactical
  and to long-term strategic planning. These forecasting problems are usually treated
  independently by learning different ML models which results in forecasts that are
  not consistent with the temporal aggregation structure, leading to inefficient decision
  making. Some of the recent work addressed this problem, however, it uses a post-hoc
  reconciliation strategy, which results in sub-optimal results and cannot produce
  probabilistic forecasts. In this paper, we present a global model that produces
  coherent, probabilistic forecasts for different time granularities by learning joint
  embeddings for the different aggregation levels with graph neural networks and temporal
  reconciliation. Temporal reconciliation not only enables consistent decisions for
  business problems across different planning horizons but also improves the quality
  of forecasts at finer time granularities. A thorough empirical evaluation illustrates
  the benefits of the proposed method.
