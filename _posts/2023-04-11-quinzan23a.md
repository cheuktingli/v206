title: Fast Feature Selection with Fairness Constraints
abstract: We study the fundamental problem of selecting optimal features for model
  construction. This problem is computationally challenging on large datasets, even
  with the use of greedy algorithm variants. To address this challenge, we extend
  the adaptive query model, recently proposed for the greedy forward selection for
  submodular functions, to the faster paradigm of Orthogonal Matching Pursuit for
  non-submodular functions. The proposed algorithm achieves exponentially fast parallel
  run time in the adaptive query model, scaling much better than prior work. Furthermore,
  our extension allows the use of downward-closed constraints, which can be used to
  encode certain fairness criteria into the feature selection process. We prove strong
  approximation guarantees for the algorithm based on standard assumptions. These
  guarantees are applicable to many parametric models, including Generalized Linear
  Models. Finally, we demonstrate empirically that the proposed algorithm competes
  favorably with state-of-the-art techniques for feature selection, on real-world
  and synthetic datasets.
