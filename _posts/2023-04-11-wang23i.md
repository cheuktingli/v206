title: Uncertainty-aware Unsupervised Video Hashing
software: https://github.com/wangyucheng1234/BerVAE
abstract: Learning to hash has become popular for video retrieval due to its fast
  speed and low storage consumption. Previous efforts formulate video hashing as training
  a binary auto-encoder, for which noncontinuous latent representations are optimized
  by the biased straight-throughÂ (ST) back-propagation heuristic. We propose to formulate
  video hashing as learning a discrete variational auto-encoder with the factorized
  Bernoulli latent distribution, termed as Bernoulli variational auto-encoder (BerVAE).
  The corresponding evidence lower bound (ELBO) in our BerVAE implementation leads
  to closed-form gradient expression, which can be applied to achieve principled training
  along with some other unbiased gradient estimators. BerVAE enables uncertainty-aware
  video hashing by predicting the probability distribution of video hash code-words,
  thus providing reliable uncertainty quantification. Experiments on both simulated
  and real-world large-scale video data demonstrate that our BerVAE trained with unbiased
  gradient estimators can achieve the state-of-the-art retrieval performance. Furthermore,
  we show that quantified uncertainty is highly correlated to video retrieval performance,
  which can be leveraged to further improve the retrieval accuracy. Our code is available
