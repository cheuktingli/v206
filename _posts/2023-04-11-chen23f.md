title: Protecting Global Properties of Datasets with Distribution Privacy Mechanisms
software: https://github.com/mgcsls/mechanisms-global-properties
abstract: We consider the problem of ensuring confidentiality of dataset properties
  aggregated over many records of a dataset. Such properties can encode sensitive
  information, such as trade secrets or demographic data, while involving a notion
  of data protection different to the privacy of individual records typically discussed
  in the literature. In this work, we demonstrate how a distribution privacy framework
  can be applied to formalize such data confidentiality. We extend the Wasserstein
  Mechanism from Pufferfish privacy and the Gaussian Mechanism from attribute privacy
  to this framework, then analyze their underlying data assumptions and how they can
  be relaxed. We then empirically evaluate the privacy-utility tradeoffs of these
  mechanisms and apply them against a practical property inference attack which targets
  global properties of datasets. The results show that our mechanisms can indeed reduce
  the effectiveness of the attack while providing utility substantially greater than
  a crude group differential privacy baseline. Our work thus provides groundwork for
  theoretical mechanisms for protecting global properties of datasets along with their
  evaluation in practice.
