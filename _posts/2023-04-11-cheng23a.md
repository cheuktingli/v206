title: 'Select and Optimize: Learning to solve large-scale TSP instances'
software: https://github.com/honey0920/select-and-optimize
abstract: Learning-based algorithms to solve TSP are getting popular in recent years,
  but most existing works cannot solve very large-scale TSP instances within a limited
  time. To solve this problem, this paper introduces a creative and distinctive method
  to select and locally optimize sub-parts of a solution. Concretely, we design a
  novel framework to generalize a small-scale selector-and-optimizer network to large-scale
  TSP instances by iteratively selecting while optimizing one sub-problem. At each
  iteration, the running time of sub-problem sampling and selection is significantly
  reduced due to the full use of parallel computing. Our neural model is well-designed
  to exploit the characteristics of the sub-problems. Furthermore, we introduce a
  trick called destroy-and-repair to avoid the local minimum of the iterative algorithm
  from a global perspective. Extensive experiments show that our method accelerates
  state-of-the-art learning-based algorithms more than 2x while achieving better solution
  quality on large-scale TSP instances ranging in size from 200 to 20,000.
