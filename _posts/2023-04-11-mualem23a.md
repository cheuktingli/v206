title: Resolving the Approximability of Offline and Online Non-monotone DR-Submodular
  Maximization over General Convex Sets
abstract: In recent years, maximization of DR-submodular continuous functions became
  an important research field, with many real-worlds applications in the domains of
  machine learning, communication systems, operation research and economics. Most
  of the works in this field study maximization subject to down-closed convex set
  constraints due to an inapproximability result by Vondrak (2013). However, Durr
  et al. (2021) showed that one can bypass this inapproximability by proving approximation
  ratios that are functions of m, the minimum $\ell-\infty$ norm of any feasible vector.
  Given this observation, it is possible to get results for maximizing a DR-submodular
  function subject to general convex set constraints, which has led to multiple works
  on this problem. The most recent of which is a polynomial time 1/4(1 - m)-approximation
  offline algorithm due to Du (2022). However, only a sub-exponential time $(1 - m)/(3^{1.5})$-approximation
  algorithm is known for the corresponding online problem. In this work, we present
  a polynomial time online algorithm matching the 1/4(1 - m)-approximation of the
  state-of-the-art offline algorithm. We also present an inapproximability result
  showing that our online algorithm and Duâ€™s (2022) offline algorithm are both optimal
  in a strong sense. Finally, we study the empirical performance of our algorithm
  and the algorithm Du (2022) (which was only theoretically studied previously), and
  show that they consistently outperform previously suggested algorithms on revenue
  maximization, location summarization and quadratic programming applications.
