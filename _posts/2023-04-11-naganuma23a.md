title: Conjugate Gradient Method for Generative Adversarial Networks
software: https://github.com/Hiroki11x/ConjugateGradient_GAN
abstract: One of the training strategies of generative models is to minimize the Jensenâ€“Shannon
  divergence between the model distribution and the data distribution. Since data
  distribution is unknown, generative adversarial networks (GANs) formulate this problem
  as a game between two models, a generator and a discriminator. The training can
  be formulated in the context of game theory and the local Nash equilibrium (LNE).
  It does not seem feasible to derive guarantees of stability or optimality for the
  existing methods. This optimization problem is far more challenging than the single
  objective setting. Here, we use the conjugate gradient method to reliably and efficiently
  solve the LNE problem in GANs. We give a proof and convergence analysis under mild
  assumptions showing that the proposed method converges to a LNE with three different
  learning rate update rules, including a constant learning rate. Finally, we demonstrate
  that the proposed method outperforms stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and momentum
  SGD in terms of best Frechet inception distance (FID) score and outperforms Adam
  on average.
