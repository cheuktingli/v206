title: Retrospective Uncertainties for Deep Models using Vine Copulas
software: https://github.com/tagas/vcnn
abstract: Despite the major progress of deep models as learning machines, uncertainty
  estimation remains a major challenge. Existing solutions rely on modified loss functions
  or architectural changes. We propose to compensate for the lack of built-in uncertainty
  estimates by supplementing any network, retrospectively, with a subsequent vine
  copula model, in an overall compound we call Vine-Copula Neural Network (VCNN).
  Through synthetic and real-data experiments, we show that VCNNs could be task (regression/classification)
  and architecture (recurrent, fully connected) agnostic while providing reliable
  and better-calibrated uncertainty estimates, comparable to state-of-the-art built-in
  uncertainty solutions.
