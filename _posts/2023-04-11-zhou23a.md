title: 'Optimizing Pessimism in Dynamic Treatment Regimes: A Bayesian Learning Approach'
software: https://github.com/yunzhe-zhou/PBL
abstract: In this article, we propose a novel pessimism-based Bayesian learning method
  for optimal dynamic treatment regimes in the offline setting. When the coverage
  condition does not hold, which is common for offline data, the existing solutions
  would produce sub-optimal policies. The pessimism principle addresses this issue
  by discouraging recommendation of actions that are less explored conditioning on
  the state. However, nearly all pessimism-based methods rely on a key hyper-parameter
  that quantifies the degree of pessimism, and the performance of the methods can
  be highly sensitive to the choice of this parameter. We propose to integrate the
  pessimism principle with Thompson sampling and Bayesian machine learning for optimizing
  the degree of pessimism. We derive a credible set whose boundary uniformly lower
  bounds the optimal Q-function, and thus we do not require additional tuning of the
  degree of pessimism. We develop a general Bayesian learning method that works with
  a range of models, from Bayesian linear basis model to Bayesian neural network model.
  We develop the computational algorithm based on variational inference, which is
  highly efficient and scalable. We establish the theoretical guarantees of the proposed
  method, and show empirically that it outperforms the existing state-of-the-art solutions
  through both simulations and a real data example.
