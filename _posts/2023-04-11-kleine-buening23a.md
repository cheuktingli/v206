title: 'ANACONDA: An Improved Dynamic Regret Algorithm for Adaptive Non-Stationary
  Dueling Bandits'
abstract: We study the problem of non-stationary dueling bandits and provide the first
  adaptive dynamic regret algorithm for this problem. The only two existing attempts
  in this line of work fall short across multiple dimensions, including pessimistic
  measures of non-stationary complexity and non-adaptive parameter tuning that requires
  knowledge of the number of preference changes. We develop an elimination-based rescheduling
  algorithm to overcome these shortcomings and show a near-optimal $\tilde O(\sqrt{S^{CW}
  T})$ dynamic regret bound, where $\S^{CW}$ is the number of times the Condorcet
  winner changes in $T$ rounds. This yields the first near-optimal dynamic regret
  bound for unknown $S^{CW}$. We further study other related notions of non-stationarity
  for which we also prove near-optimal dynamic regret guarantees under additional
  assumptions on the preference model.
