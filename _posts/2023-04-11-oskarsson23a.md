title: Temporal Graph Neural Networks for Irregular Data
software: https://github.com/joeloskarsson/tgnn4i
abstract: This paper proposes a temporal graph neural network model for forecasting
  of graph-structured irregularly observed time series. Our TGNN4I model is designed
  to handle both irregular time steps and partial observations of the graph. This
  is achieved by introducing a time-continuous latent state in each node, following
  a linear Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) defined by the output of a Gated Recurrent
  Unit (GRU). The ODE has an explicit solution as a combination of exponential decay
  and periodic dynamics. Observations in the graph neighborhood are taken into account
  by integrating graph neural network layers in both the GRU state update and predictive
  model. The time-continuous dynamics additionally enable the model to make predictions
  at arbitrary time steps. We propose a loss function that leverages this and allows
  for training the model for forecasting over different time horizons. Experiments
  on simulated data and real-world data from traffic and climate modeling validate
  the usefulness of both the graph structure and time-continuous dynamics in settings
  with irregular observations.
