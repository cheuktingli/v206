title: 'Random Features Model with General Convex Regularization: A Fine Grained Analysis
  with Precise Asymptotic Learning Curves'
abstract: We compute precise asymptotic expressions for the learning curves of least
  squares random feature (RF) models with either a separable strongly convex regularization
  or the $\ell_1$ regularization. We propose a novel multi-level application of the
  convex Gaussian min max theorem (CGMT) to overcome the traditional difficulty of
  finding computable expressions for random features models with correlated data.
  Our result takes the form of a computable 4-dimensional scalar optimization. In
  contrast to previous results, our approach does not require solving an often intractable
  proximal operator, which scales with the number of model parameters. Furthermore,
  we extend the universality results for the training and generalization errors for
  RF models to $\ell_1$ regularization. In particular, we demonstrate that under mild
  conditions, random feature models with elastic net or $\ell_1$ regularization are
  asymptotically equivalent to a surrogate Gaussian model with the same first and
  second moments. We numerically demonstrate the predictive capacity of our results,
  and show experimentally that the predicted test error is accurate even in the non-asymptotic
  regime.
