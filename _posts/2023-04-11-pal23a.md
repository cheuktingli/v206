title: Optimal Algorithms for Latent Bandits with Cluster Structure
abstract: We consider the problem of latent bandits with cluster structure where there
  are multiple users, each with an associated multi-armed bandit problem. These users
  are grouped into latent clusters such that the mean reward vectors of users within
  the same cluster are identical. At each round, a user, selected uniformly at random,
  pulls an arm and observes a corresponding noisy reward. The goal of the users is
  to maximize their cumulative rewards. This problem is central to practical recommendation
  systems and has received wide attention of late Gentile et al. (2014), Maillard
  and Mannor (2014). Now, if each user acts independently, then they would have to
  explore each arm independently and a regret of $\Omega(\sqrt{\mathrm{MNT}})$ is
  unavoidable, where M, N are the number of arms and users, respectively. Instead,
  we propose LATTICE (Latent bAndiTs via maTrIx ComplEtion) which allows exploration
  of the latent cluster structure to provide the minimax optimal regret of $\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{(M+N)T})$
  when the number of clusters is $\tilde O(1)$. This is the first algorithm to guarantee
  such strong regret bound. LATTICE is based on a careful exploitation of arm information
  within a cluster while simultaneously clustering users. Furthermore, it is computationally
  efficient and requires only $O(\log \mathrm{T})$ calls to an offline matrix completion
  oracle across all T rounds.
