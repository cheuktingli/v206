title: 'The Role of Codeword-to-Class Assignments in Error-Correcting Codes: An Empirical
  Study'
software: https://github.com/ievron/wltls
abstract: Error-correcting codes (ECC) are used to reduce multiclass classification
  tasks to multiple binary classification subproblems. In ECC, classes are represented
  by the rows of a binary matrix, corresponding to codewords in a codebook. Codebooks
  are commonly either predefined or problem dependent. Given predefined codebooks,
  codeword-to-class assignments are traditionally overlooked, and codewords are implicitly
  assigned to classes arbitrarily. Our paper shows that these assignments play a major
  role in the performance of ECC. Specifically, we examine similarity-preserving assignments,
  where similar codewords are assigned to similar classes. Addressing a controversy
  in existing literature, our extensive experiments confirm that similarity-preserving
  assignments induce easier subproblems and are superior to other assignment policies
  in terms of their generalization performance. We find that similarity-preserving
  assignments make predefined codebooks become problem-dependent, without altering
  other favorable codebook properties. Finally, we show that our findings can improve
  predefined codebooks dedicated to extreme classification.
