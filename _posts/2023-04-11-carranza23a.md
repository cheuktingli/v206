title: Flexible and Efficient Contextual Bandits with Heterogeneous Treatment Effect
  Oracles
software: https://github.com/agcarranza/hte-bandits
abstract: Contextual bandit algorithms often estimate reward models to inform decision-making.
  However, true rewards can contain action-independent redundancies that are not relevant
  for decision-making. We show it is more data-efficient to estimate any function
  that explains the reward differences between actions, that is, the treatment effects.
  Motivated by this observation, building on recent work on oracle-based bandit algorithms,
  we provide the first reduction of contextual bandits to general-purpose heterogeneous
  treatment effect estimation, and we design a simple and computationally efficient
  algorithm based on this reduction. Our theoretical and experimental results demonstrate
  that heterogeneous treatment effect estimation in contextual bandits offers practical
  advantages over reward estimation including more efficient model estimation and
  greater flexibility to model misspecification.
