title: Approximate Regions of Attraction in Learning with Decision-Dependent Distributions
abstract: As data-driven methods are deployed in real-world settings, the processes
  that generate the observed data will often react to the decisions of the learner.
  For example, a data source may have some incentive for the algorithm to provide
  a particular label (e.g. approve a bank loan), and manipulate their features accordingly.
  Work in strategic classification and decision-dependent distributions seeks to characterize
  the closed-loop behavior of deploying learning algorithms by explicitly considering
  the effect of the classifier on the underlying data distribution. More recently,
  works in performative prediction seek to classify the closed-loop behavior by considering
  general properties of the mapping from classifier to data distribution, rather than
  an explicit form. Building on this notion, we analyze repeated risk minimization
  as the perturbed trajectories of the gradient flows of performative risk minimization.
  We consider the case where there may be multiple local minimizers of performative
  risk, motivated by situations where the initial conditions may have significant
  impact on the long-term behavior of the system. We provide sufficient conditions
  to characterize the region of attraction for the various equilibria in this settings.
  Additionally, we introduce the notion of performative alignment, which provides
  a geometric condition on the convergence of repeated risk minimization to performative
  risk minimizers.
