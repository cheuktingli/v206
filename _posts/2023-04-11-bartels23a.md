title: Adaptive Cholesky Gaussian Processes
software: https://github.com/SimonBartels/acgp
abstract: We present a method to approximate Gaussian process regression models to
  large datasets by considering only a subset of the data. Our approach is novel in
  that the size of the subset is selected on the fly during exact inference with little
  computational overhead. From an empirical observation that the log-marginal likelihood
  often exhibits a linear trend once a sufficient subset of a dataset has been observed,
  we conclude that many large datasets contain redundant information that only slightly
  affects the posterior. Based on this, we provide probabilistic bounds on the full
  model evidence that can identify such subsets. Remarkably, these bounds are largely
  composed of terms that appear in intermediate steps of the standard Cholesky decomposition,
  allowing us to modify the algorithm to adaptively stop the decomposition once enough
  data have been observed.
