title: Fast Variational Estimation of Mutual Information for Implicit and Explicit
  Likelihood Models
abstract: Computing mutual information (MI) of random variables lacks a closed-form
  in nontrivial models. Variational MI approximations are widely used as flexible
  estimators for this purpose, but computing them typically requires solving a costly
  nonconvex optimization. We prove that a widely used class of variational MI estimators
  can be solved via moment matching operations in place of the numerical optimization
  methods that are typically required. We show that the same moment matching solution
  yields variational estimates for so-called “implicit” models that lack a closed
  form likelihood function. Furthermore, we demonstrate that this moment matching
  solution has multiple orders of magnitude computational speed up compared to the
  standard optimization based solutions. We show that theoretical results are supported
  by numerical evaluation in fully parameterized Gaussian mixture models and a generalized
  linear model with implicit likelihood due to nuisance variables. We also demonstrate
  on the implicit simulation-based likelihood SIR epidemiology model, where we avoid
  costly likelihood free inference and observe many orders of magnitude speedup.
