abstract: Many machine learning problems encode their data as a matrix with a possibly
  very large number of rows and columns. In several applications like neuroscience,
  image compression or deep reinforcement learning, the principal subspace of such
  a matrix provides a useful, low-dimensional representation of individual data. Here,
  we are interested in determining the $d$-dimensional principal subspace of a given
  matrix from sample entries, i.e. from small random submatrices. Although a number
  of sample-based methods exist for this problem (e.g. Ojaâ€™s rule (Oja, 1982)), these
  assume access to full columns of the matrix or particular matrix structure such
  as symmetry and cannot be combined as-is with neural networks (Baldi et al., 1989).
  In this paper, we derive an algorithm that learns a principal subspace from sample
  entries, can be applied when the approximate subspace is represented by a neural
  network, and hence can be scaled to datasets with an effectively infinite number
  of rows and columns. Our method consists in defining a loss function whose minimizer
  is the desired principal subspace, and constructing a gradient estimate of this
  loss whose bias can be controlled. We complement our theoretical analysis with a
  series of experiments on synthetic matrices, the MNIST dataset (LeCun et al. 2010)
  and the reinforcement learning domain PuddleWorld (Sutton, 1995) demonstrating the
  usefulness of our approach.
