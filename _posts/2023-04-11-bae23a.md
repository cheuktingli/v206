title: Deep Value Function Networks for Large-Scale Multistage Stochastic Programs
software: https://github.com/HyunglipBae/DVFN
abstract: 'A neural networks-based stagewise decomposition algorithm called Deep Value
  Function Networks (DVFN) is proposed for large-scale multistage stochastic programming
  (MSP) problems. Traditional approaches such as nested Benders decomposition and
  its stochastic variant, stochastic dual dynamic programming (SDDP) approximates
  value functions as piecewise linear convex functions by gradually accumulating subgradient
  cuts from dual solutions of stagewise subproblems. Although they have been proven
  effective for linear problems, nonlinear problems may suffer from the increasing
  number of subgradient cuts as they proceed. A recently developed algorithm called
  Value Function Gradient Learning (VFGL) replaced the piecewise linear approximation
  with parametric function approximation, but its performance heavily depends upon
  the choice of parametric forms like most of traditional parametric machine learning
  algorithms did. On the other hand, DVFN approximates value functions using neural
  networks, which are known to have huge capacity in terms of their functional representations.
  The art of choosing appropriate parametric form becomes a simple labor of hyperparameter
  search for neural networks. However, neural networks are non-convex in general,
  and it would make the learning process unstable. We resolve this issue by using
  input convex neural networks that guarantee convexity with respect to inputs. We
  compare DVFN with SDDP and VFGL for solving large-scale linear and nonlinear MSP
  problems: production optimization and energy planning. Numerical examples clearly
  indicate that DVFN provide accurate and computationally efficient solutions.'
