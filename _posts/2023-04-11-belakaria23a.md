title: 'Bayesian Optimization Over Iterative Learners with Structured Responses: A
  Budget-aware Planning Approach'
abstract: The rising growth of deep neural networks (DNNs) and datasets in size motivates
  the need for efficient solutions for simultaneous model selection and training.
  Many methods for hyperparameter optimization (HPO) of iterative learners, including
  DNNs, attempt to solve this problem by querying and learning a response surface
  while searching for the optimum of that surface. However, many of these methods
  make myopic queries, do not consider prior knowledge about the response structure,
  and/or perform a biased cost-aware search, all of which exacerbate identifying the
  best-performing model when a total cost budget is specified. This paper proposes
  a novel approach referred to as Budget-Aware Planning for Iterative Learners (BAPI)
  to solve HPO problems under a constrained cost budget. BAPI is an efficient non-myopic
  Bayesian optimization solution that accounts for the budget and leverages the prior
  knowledge about the objective function and cost function to select better configurations
  and to take more informed decisions during the evaluation (training). Experiments
  on diverse HPO benchmarks for iterative learners show that BAPI performs better
  than state-of-the-art baselines in most cases.
