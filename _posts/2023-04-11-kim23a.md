title: Characterizing Internal Evasion Attacks in Federated Learning
software: https://github.com/tj-kim/pFedDef_v1
abstract: 'Federated learning allows for clients in a distributed system to jointly
  train a machine learning model. However, clients’ models are vulnerable to attacks
  during the training and testing phases. In this paper, we address the issue of adversarial
  clients performing “internal evasion attacks”: crafting evasion attacks at test
  time to deceive other clients. For example, adversaries may aim to deceive spam
  filters and recommendation systems trained with federated learning for monetary
  gain. The adversarial clients have extensive information about the victim model
  in a federated learning setting, as weight information is shared amongst clients.
  We are the first to characterize the transferability of such internal evasion attacks
  for different learning methods and analyze the trade-off between model accuracy
  and robustness depending on the degree of similarities in client data. We show that
  adversarial training defenses in the federated learning setting only display limited
  improvements against internal attacks. However, combining adversarial training with
  personalized federated learning frameworks increases relative internal attack robustness
  by 60$%$ compared to federated adversarial training and performs well under limited
  system resources.'
