title: Improved Bound on Generalization Error of Compressed KNN Estimator
software: https://github.com/hangzhang390/Compressed-KNN.git
abstract: This paper studies the generalization capability of the compressed $k$-nearest
  neighbor (KNN) estimator, where randomly-projected low-dimensional data are put
  into the KNN estimator rather than the high-dimensional raw data. Considering both
  regression and classification, we give improved bounds on its generalization errors,
  to put more specific, $\ell_2$ error for regression and mis-classification rate
  for classification. As a byproduct of our analysis, we prove that ordered distance
  is almost preserved with random projections, which we believe is for the first time.
  In addition, we provide numerical experiments on various public datasets to verify
  our theorems.
