title: On the Calibration of Probabilistic Classifier Sets
software: https://github.com/tfmortie/calibration
abstract: Multi-class classification methods that produce sets of probabilistic classifiers,
  such as ensemble learning methods, are able to model aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty.
  Aleatoric uncertainty is then typically quantified via the Bayes error, and epistemic
  uncertainty via the size of the set. In this paper, we extend the notion of calibration,
  which is commonly used to evaluate the validity of the aleatoric uncertainty representation
  of a single probabilistic classifier, to assess the validity of an epistemic uncertainty
  representation obtained by sets of probabilistic classifiers. Broadly speaking,
  we call a set of probabilistic classifiers calibrated if one can find a calibrated
  convex combination of these classifiers. To evaluate this notion of calibration,
  we propose a novel nonparametric calibration test that generalizes an existing test
  for single probabilistic classifiers to the case of sets of probabilistic classifiers.
  Making use of this test, we empirically show that ensembles of deep neural networks
  are often not well calibrated.
