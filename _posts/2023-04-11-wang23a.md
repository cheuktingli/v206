title: Regularization for Shuffled Data Problems via Exponential Family Priors on
  the Permutation Group
software: https://github.com/bruce1edward/exp_prior_shuffled_data
abstract: In the analysis of data sets consisting of (X, Y)-pairs, a tacit assumption
  is that each pair corresponds to the same observational unit. If, however, such
  pairs are obtained via record linkage of two files, this assumption can be violated
  as a result of mismatch error rooting, for example, in the lack of reliable identifiers
  in the two files. Recently, there has been a surge of interest in this setting under
  the term “Shuffled Data” in which the underlying correct pairing of (X, Y)-pairs
  is represented via an unknown permutation. Explicit modeling of the permutation
  tends to be associated with overfitting, prompting the need for suitable methods
  of regularization. In this paper, we propose an exponential family prior on the
  permutation group for this purpose that can be used to integrate various structures
  such as sparse and local shuffling. This prior turns out to be conjugate for canonical
  shuffled data problems in which the likelihood conditional on a fixed permutation
  can be expressed as product over the corresponding (X,Y)-pairs. Inference can be
  based on the EM algorithm in which the E-step is approximated by sampling, e.g.,
  via the Fisher-Yates algorithm. The M-step is shown to admit a reduction from $n^2$
  to $n$ terms if the likelihood of (X,Y)-pairs has exponential family form. Comparisons
  on synthetic and real data show that the proposed approach compares favorably to
  competing methods.
