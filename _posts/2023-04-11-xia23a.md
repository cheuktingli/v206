title: 'Krylov–Bellman boosting: Super-linear policy evaluation in general state spaces'
abstract: We present and analyze the Krylov–Bellman Boosting algorithm for policy
  evaluation in general state spaces. It alternates between fitting the Bellman residual
  using non-parametric regression (as in boosting), and estimating the value function
  via the least-squares temporal difference (LSTD) procedure applied with a feature
  set that grows adaptively over time. By exploiting the connection to Krylov methods,
  we equip this method with two attractive guarantees. First, we provide a general
  convergence bound that allows for separate estimation errors in residual fitting
  and LSTD computation. Consistent with our numerical experiments, this bound shows
  that convergence rates depend on the restricted spectral structure, and are typically
  super-linear. Second, by combining this meta-result with sample-size dependent guarantees
  for residual fitting and LTSD computation, we obtain concrete statistical guarantees
  that depend on the sample size along with the complexity of the function class used
  to fit the residuals. We illustrate the behavior of the KBB algorithm for various
  types of policy evaluation problems, and typically find large reductions in sample
  complexity relative to the standard approach of fitted value iteration.
