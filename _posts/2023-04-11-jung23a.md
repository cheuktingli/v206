title: Bayesian Convolutional Deep Sets with Task-Dependent Stationary Prior
software: https://github.com/becre2021/BayesConvdeepset
abstract: Convolutional deep sets is a neural network architecture that can model
  stationary stochastic processes. This architecture uses the kernel smoother and
  deep convolutional neural network to construct translation equivariant functional
  representations. However, the non-parametric nature of the kernel smoother can produce
  ambiguous representations when the number of data points is not given sufficiently.
  To address this issue, we introduce bayesian convolutional deep sets, which constructs
  random translation equivariant functional representations with a stationary prior.
  Furthermore, we present how to impose the task-dependent prior for each dataset
  because a wrongly imposed prior can result in an even worse representation than
  that of the kernel smoother. Empirically, we demonstrate that the proposed architecture
  alleviates the targeted issue in various experiments with time-series and image
  datasets.
