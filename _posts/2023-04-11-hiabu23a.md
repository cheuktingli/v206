title: Unifying local and global model explanations by functional decomposition of
  low dimensional structures
software: 'https://github.com/PlantedML/glex_paper. '
abstract: We consider a global representation of a regression or classification function
  by decomposing it into the sum of main and interaction components of arbitrary order.
  We propose a new identification constraint that allows for the extraction of interventional
  SHAP values and partial dependence plots, thereby unifying local and global explanations.
  With our proposed identification, a feature’s partial dependence plot corresponds
  to the main effect term plus the intercept. The interventional SHAP value of feature
  $k$ is a weighted sum of the main component and all interaction components that
  include $k$, with the weights given by the reciprocal of the component’s dimension.
  This brings a new perspective to local explanations such as SHAP values which were
  previously motivated by game theory only. We show that the decomposition can be
  used to reduce direct and indirect bias by removing all components that include
  a protected feature. Lastly, we motivate a new measure of feature importance. In
  principle, our proposed functional decomposition can be applied to any machine learning
  model, but exact calculation is only feasible for low-dimensional structures or
  ensembles of those. We provide an algorithm and efficient implementation for gradient-boosted
  trees (xgboost) and random planted forest. Conducted experiments suggest that our
  method provides meaningful explanations and reveals interactions of higher orders.
  The proposed methods are implemented in an R package, available at https://github.com/PlantedML/glex.
