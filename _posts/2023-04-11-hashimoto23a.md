title: 'Learning in RKHM: a C*-Algebraic Twist for Kernel Machines'
abstract: Supervised learning in reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) and vector-valued
  RKHS (vvRKHS) has been investigated for more than 30 years. In this paper, we provide
  a new twist to this rich literature by generalizing supervised learning in RKHS
  and vvRKHS to reproducing kernel Hilbert C*-module (RKHM), and show how to construct
  effective positive-definite kernels by considering the perspective of C*-algebra.
  Unlike the cases of RKHS and vvRKHS, we can use C*-algebras to enlarge representation
  spaces. This enables us to construct RKHMs whose representation power goes beyond
  RKHSs, vvRKHSs, and existing methods such as convolutional neural networks. Our
  framework is suitable, for example, for effectively analyzing image data by allowing
  the interaction of Fourier components.
