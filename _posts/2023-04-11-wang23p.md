title: Huber-robust confidence sequences
software: https://github.com/ShimonTroiaeAbOrisWang/catoni-confseq
abstract: Confidence sequences are confidence intervals that can be sequentially tracked,
  and are valid at arbitrary data-dependent stopping times. This paper presents confidence
  sequences for a univariate mean of an unknown distribution with a known upper bound
  on the p-th central moment (p $>$ 1), but allowing for (at most) $\varepsilon$ fraction
  of arbitrary distribution corruption, as in Huberâ€™s contamination model. We do this
  by designing new robust exponential supermartingales, and show that the resulting
  confidence sequences attain the optimal width achieved in the nonsequential setting.
  Perhaps surprisingly, the constant margin between our sequential result and the
  lower bound is smaller than even fixed-time robust confidence intervals based on
  the trimmed mean, for example. Since confidence sequences are a common tool used
  within A/B/n testing and bandits, these results open the door to sequential experimentation
  that is robust to outliers and adversarial corruptions.
