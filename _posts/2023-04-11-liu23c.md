title: Adaptation to Misspecified Kernel Regularity in Kernelised Bandits
abstract: 'In continuum-armed bandit problems where the underlying function resides
  in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS), namely, the kernelised bandit problems,
  an important open problem remains of how well learning algorithms can adapt if the
  regularity of the associated kernel function is unknown. In this work, we study
  adaptivity to the regularity of translation-invariant kernels, which is characterized
  by the decay rate of the Fourier transformation of the kernel, in the bandit setting.
  We derive an adaptivity lower bound, proving that it is impossible to simultaneously
  achieve optimal cumulative regret in a pair of RKHSs with different regularities.
  To verify the tightness of this lower bound, we show that an existing bandit model
  selection algorithm applied with minimax non-adaptive kernelised bandit algorithms
  matches the lower bound in dependence of T, the total number of steps, except for
  log factors. By filling in the regret bounds for adaptivity between RKHSs, we connect
  the statistical difficulty for adaptivity in continuum-armed bandits in three fundamental
  types of function spaces: RKHS, Sobolev space, and Holder space.'
