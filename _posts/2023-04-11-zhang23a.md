title: Leveraging Instance Features for Label Aggregation in Programmatic Weak Supervision
software: https://github.com/JieyuZ2/wrench/blob/main/wrench/labelmodel/fable.py
abstract: Programmatic Weak Supervision (PWS) has emerged as a widespread paradigm
  to synthesize training labels efficiently. The core component of PWS is the label
  model, which infers true labels by aggregating the outputs of multiple noisy supervision
  sources abstracted as labeling functions (LFs). Existing statistical label models
  typically rely only on the outputs of LF, ignoring the instance features when modeling
  the underlying generative process. In this paper, we attempt to incorporate the
  instance features into a statistical label model via the proposed FABLE. In particular,
  it is built on a mixture of Bayesian label models, each corresponding to a global
  pattern of correlation, and the coefficients of the mixture components are predicted
  by a Gaussian Process classifier based on instance features. We adopt an auxiliary
  variable-based variational inference algorithm to tackle the non-conjugate issue
  between the Gaussian Process and Bayesian label models. Extensive empirical comparison
  on eleven benchmark datasets sees FABLE achieving the highest averaged performance
  across nine baselines. Our implementation of FABLE can be found in https://github.com/JieyuZ2/wrench/blob/main/wrench/labelmodel/fable.py.
