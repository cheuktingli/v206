title: On the Neural Tangent Kernel Analysis of Randomly Pruned Neural Networks
software: https://github.com/VITA-Group/Random-Pruning-NTK
abstract: Motivated by both theory and practice, we study how random pruning the weights
  affects a neural network’s neural tangent kernel (NTK). In particular, this work
  establishes an equivalence of the NTKs between a fully-connected neural network
  and its randomly pruned version. The equivalence is established under two cases.
  The first main result studies the infinite-width asymptotic. It is shown that given
  a pruning probability, for fully-connected neural networks with the weights randomly
  pruned at the initialization, as the width of each layer grows to infinity sequentially,
  the NTK of the pruned neural network converges to the limiting NTK of the original
  network with some extra scaling. If the network weights are rescaled appropriately
  after pruning, this extra scaling can be removed. The second main result considers
  the finite width case. It is shown that to ensure the NTK’s closeness to the limit,
  the dependence of width on the sparsity parameter is asymptotically linear, as the
  NTK’s gap to its limit goes down to zero. Moreover, if the pruning probability is
  set to zero (i.e., no pruning), the bound on the required width matches the bound
  for fully-connected neural networks in previous works up to logarithmic factors.
  The proof of this result requires developing novel analysis of a network structure
  which we called mask-induced pseudo-networks.Experiments are provided to evaluate
  our results.
