title: Nonstochastic Contextual Combinatorial Bandits
software: https://github.com/LukasZierahn/Combinatorial-Contextual-Bandits
abstract: 'We study a contextual version of online combinatorial optimisation with
  full and semi-bandit feedback. In this sequential decision-making problem, an online
  learner has to select an action from a combinatorial decision space after seeing
  a vector-valued context in each round. As a result of its action, the learner incurs
  a loss that is a bilinear function of the context vector and the vector representation
  of the chosen action. We consider two natural versions of the problem: semi-bandit
  where the losses are revealed for each component appearing in the learner’s combinatorial
  action, and full-bandit where only the total loss is observed. We design computationally
  efficient algorithms based on a new loss estimator that takes advantage of the special
  structure of the problem, and show regret bounds order $\sqrt{T}$ with respect to
  the time horizon. The bounds demonstrate polynomial scaling with the relevant problem
  parameters which is shown to be nearly optimal. The theoretical results are complemented
  by a set of experiments on simulated data.'
