title: Delayed Feedback in Generalised Linear Bandits Revisited
abstract: The stochastic generalised linear bandit is a well-understood model for
  sequential decision-making problems, with many algorithms achieving near-optimal
  regret guarantees under immediate feedback. However, the stringent requirement for
  immediate rewards is unmet in many real-world applications where the reward is almost
  always delayed. We study the phenomenon of delayed rewards in generalised linear
  bandits in a theoretical manner. We show that a natural adaptation of an optimistic
  algorithm to the delayed feedback setting can achieve regret of $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(d\sqrt{T}
  + d^{3/2}\mathbb{E}[\tau]\,)$, where $\mathbb{E}[\tau]$ denotes the expected delay,
  $d$ is the dimension and $T$ is the time horizon. This significantly improves upon
  existing approaches for this setting where the best known regret bound was $ \widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{dT}\sqrt{d
  + \mathbb{E}[\tau]}\,)$. We verify our theoretical results through experiments on
  simulated data.
