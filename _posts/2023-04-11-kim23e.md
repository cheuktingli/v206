title: 'SwAMP: Swapped Assignment of Multi-Modal Pairs for Cross-Modal Retrieval'
abstract: We tackle the cross-modal retrieval problem, where learning is only supervised
  by the relevant multi-modal pairs in the data. Although the contrastive learning
  is the most popular approach for this task, it makes potentially wrong assumption
  that the instances in different pairs are automatically irrelevant. To address the
  issue, we propose a novel loss function that is based on self-labeling of the unknown
  semantic classes. Specifically, we aim to predict class labels of the data instances
  in each modality, and assign those labels to the corresponding instances in the
  other modality (i.e., swapping the pseudo labels). With these swapped labels, we
  learn the data embedding for each modality using the supervised cross-entropy loss.
  This way, cross-modal instances from different pairs that are semantically related
  can be aligned to each other by the class predictor. We tested our approach on several
  real-world cross-modal retrieval problems, including text-based video retrieval,
  sketch-based image retrieval, and image-text retrieval. For all these tasks our
  method achieves significant performance improvement over the contrastive learning.
