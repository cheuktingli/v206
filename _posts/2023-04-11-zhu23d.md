title: Likelihood-Based Generative Radiance Field with Latent Space Energy-Based Model
  for 3D-Aware Disentangled Image Representation
software: https://github.com/AlvinZhuyx/NeRF-LEBM/
abstract: 'We propose the NeRF-LEBM, a likelihoodbased top-down 3D-aware 2D image
  generative model that incorporates 3D representation via Neural Radiance Fields
  (NeRF) and 2D imaging process via differentiable volume rendering. The model represents
  an image as a rendering process from 3D object to 2D image and is conditioned on
  some latent variables that account for object characteristics and are assumed to
  follow informative trainable energy-based prior models. We propose two likelihood-based
  learning frameworks to train the NeRF-LEBM: (i) maximum likelihood estimation with
  Markov chain Monte Carlo-based inference and (ii) variational inference with the
  reparameterization trick. We study our models in the scenarios with both known and
  unknown camera poses. Experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that
  the NeRF-LEBM can infer 3D object structures from 2D images, generate 2D images
  with novel views and objects, learn from incomplete 2D images, and learn from 2D
  images with known or unknown camera poses.'
