title: 'Freeze then Train: Towards Provable Representation Learning under Spurious
  Correlations and Feature Noise'
software: https://github.com/YWolfeee/Freeze-Then-Train
abstract: The existence of spurious correlations such as image backgrounds in the
  training environment can make empirical risk minimization (ERM) perform badly in
  the test environment. To address this problem, Kirichenko et al. (2022) empirically
  found that the core features that are related to the outcome can still be learned
  well even with the presence of spurious correlations. This opens a promising strategy
  to first train a feature learner rather than a classifier, and then perform linear
  probing (last layer retraining) in the test environment. However, a theoretical
  understanding of when and why this approach works is lacking. In this paper, we
  find that core features are only learned well when their associated non-realizable
  noise is smaller than that of spurious features, which is not necessarily true in
  practice. We provide both theories and experiments to support this finding and to
  illustrate the importance of non-realizable noise. Moreover, we propose an algorithm
  called Freeze then Train (FTT), that first freezes certain salient features and
  then trains the rest of the features using ERM. We theoretically show that FTT preserves
  features that are more beneficial to test time probing. Across two commonly used
  spurious correlation datasets, FTT outperforms ERM, IRM, JTT and CVaR-DRO, with
  substantial improvement in accuracy (by 4.5$%$) when the feature noise is large.
  FTT also performs better on general distribution shift benchmarks.
