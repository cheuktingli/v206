title: Semi-Verified PAC Learning from the Crowd
abstract: We study the problem of crowdsourced PAC learning of threshold functions.
  This is a challenging problem and only recently have query-efficient algorithms
  been established under the assumption that a noticeable fraction of the workers
  are perfect. In this work, we investigate a more challenging case where the majority
  may behave adversarially and the rest behave as the Massart noise â€“ a significant
  generalization of the perfectness assumption. We show that under the semi-verified
  model of Charikar et al. (2017), where we have (limited) access to a trusted oracle
  who always returns correct annotations, it is possible to PAC learn the underlying
  hypothesis class with a manageable amount of label queries. Moreover, we show that
  the labeling cost can be drastically mitigated via the more easily obtained comparison
  queries. Orthogonal to recent developments in semi-verified or list-decodable learning
  that crucially rely on data distributional assumptions, our PAC guarantee holds
  by exploring the wisdom of the crowd.
