title: Computing Abductive Explanations for Boosted Trees
software: www.cril.fr/expekctation/aistats23.zip
abstract: Boosted trees is a dominant ML model, exhibiting high accuracy. However,
  boosted trees are hardly intelligible, and this is a problem whenever they are used
  in safety-critical applications. Indeed, in such a context, provably sound explanations
  for the predictions made are expected. Recent work have shown how subset-minimal
  abductive explanations can be derived for boosted trees, using automated reasoning
  techniques. However, the generation of such well-founded explanations is intractable
  in the general case. To improve the scalability of their generation, we introduce
  the notion of tree-specific explanation for a boosted tree. We show that tree-specific
  explanations are provably sound abductive explanations that can be computed in polynomial
  time. We also explain how to derive a subset-minimal abductive explanation from
  a tree-specific explanation. Experiments on various datasets show the computational
  benefits of leveraging tree-specific explanations for deriving subset-minimal abductive
  explanations.
