title: 'Weather2K: A Multivariate Spatio-Temporal Benchmark Dataset for Meteorological
  Forecasting Based on Real-Time Observation Data from Ground Weather Stations'
abstract: 'Weather forecasting is one of the cornerstones of meteorological work.
  In this paper, we present a new benchmark dataset named Weather2K, which aims to
  make up for the deficiencies of existing weather forecasting datasets in terms of
  real-time, reliability, and diversity, as well as the key bottleneck of data quality.
  To be specific, our Weather2K is featured from the following aspects: 1) Reliable
  and real-time data. The data is hourly collected from 2,130 ground weather stations
  covering an area of 6 million square kilometers. 2) Multivariate meteorological
  variables. 20 meteorological factors and 3 constants for position information are
  provided with a length of 40,896 time steps. 3) Applicable to diverse tasks. We
  conduct a set of baseline tests on time series forecasting and spatio-temporal forecasting.
  To the best of our knowledge, our Weather2K is the first attempt to tackle weather
  forecasting task by taking full advantage of the strengths of observation data from
  ground weather stations. Based on Weather2K, we further propose Meteorological Factors
  based Multi-Graph Convolution Network (MFMGCN), which can effectively construct
  the intrinsic correlation among geographic locations based on meteorological factors.
  Sufficient experiments show that MFMGCN improves both the forecasting performance
  and temporal robustness. We hope our Weather2K can significantly motivate researchers
  to develop efficient and accurate algorithms to advance the task of weather forecasting.
  The dataset can be available at https://github.com/bycnfz/weather2k/.'
