title: Clustering above Exponential Families with Tempered Exponential Measures
abstract: The link with exponential families has allowed k-means clustering to be
  generalized to a wide variety of data-generating distributions in exponential families
  and clustering distortions among Bregman divergences. Getting the framework to go
  beyond exponential families is important to lift roadblocks like the lack of robustness
  of some population minimizers, which is carved into their axiomatization. Current
  generalizations of exponential families like the q-exponential families or even
  the deformed exponential families fail at achieving the goal. In this paper, we
  provide a new attempt at getting a complete framework, grounded in a new generalization
  of exponential families that we introduce, called tempered exponential measures
  (TEMs). TEMs keep the maximum entropy axiomatization framework of q-exponential
  families, but instead of normalizing the measure, normalize a dual called a co-distribution.
  Numerous interesting properties arise for clustering, such as improved and controllable
  robustness for population minimizers, that keep a simple analytic form.
