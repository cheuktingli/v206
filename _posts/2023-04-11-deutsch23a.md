title: Graph Spectral Embedding using the Geodesic Betweenness Centrality
abstract: We introduce the Graph Sylvester Embedding (GSE), an unsupervised graph
  representation of local similarity, connectivity, and global structure. GSE uses
  the solution of the Sylvester equation to capture both network structure and neighborhood
  proximity in a single representation. Unlike embeddings based on the eigenvectors
  of the Laplacian, GSE incorporates two or more basis functions, for instance using
  the Laplacian and the affinity matrix. Such basis functions are constructed not
  from the original graph, but from one whose weights measure the centrality of an
  edge (the fraction of the number of shortest paths that pass through that edge)
  in the original graph. This allows more flexibility and control to represent complex
  network structure and shows significant improvements over the state of the art when
  used for data analysis tasks such as predicting failed edges in material science
  and network alignment in the human-SARS CoV-2 protein-protein interactome.
