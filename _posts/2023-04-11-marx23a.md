title: But Are You Sure? An Uncertainty-Aware Perspective on Explainable AI
software: https://github.com/charliemarx/datax
abstract: 'Although black-box models can accurately predict outcomes such as weather
  patterns, they often lack transparency, making it challenging to extract meaningful
  insights (such as which atmospheric conditions signal future rainfall). Model explanations
  attempt to identify the essential features of a model, but these explanations can
  be inconsistent: two near-optimal models may admit vastly different explanations.
  In this paper, we propose a solution to this problem by constructing uncertainty
  sets for explanations of the optimal model(s) in both frequentist and Bayesian settings.
  Our uncertainty sets are guaranteed to include the explanation of the optimal model
  with high probability, even though this model is unknown. We demonstrate the effectiveness
  of our approach in both synthetic and real-world experiments, illustrating how our
  uncertainty sets can be used to calibrate trust in model explanations.'
