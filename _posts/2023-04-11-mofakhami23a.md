title: Performative Prediction with Neural Networks
software: https://github.com/mhrnz/Performative-Prediction-with-Neural-Networks
abstract: Performative prediction is a framework for learning models that influence
  the data they intend to predict. We focus on finding classifiers that are performatively
  stable, i.e. optimal for the data distribution they induce. Standard convergence
  results for finding a performatively stable classifier with the method of repeated
  risk minimization assume that the data distribution is Lipschitz continuous to the
  model’s parameters. Under this assumption, the loss must be strongly convex and
  smooth in these parameters; otherwise, the method will diverge for some problems.
  In this work, we instead assume that the data distribution is Lipschitz continuous
  with respect to the model’s predictions, a more natural assumption for performative
  systems. As a result, we are able to significantly relax the assumptions on the
  loss function. In particular, we do not need to assume convexity with respect to
  the model’s parameters. As an illustration, we introduce a resampling procedure
  that models realistic distribution shifts and show that it satisfies our assumptions.
  We support our theory by showing that one can learn performatively stable classifiers
  with neural networks making predictions about real data that shift according to
  our proposed procedure.
