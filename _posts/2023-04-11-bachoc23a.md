title: Gaussian Processes on Distributions based on Regularized Optimal Transport
software: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/SinkhornMuGP-D37E/README.md
abstract: We present a novel kernel over the space of probability measures based on
  the dual formulation of optimal regularized transport. We propose an Hilbertian
  embedding of the space of probabilities using their Sinkhorn potentials, which are
  solutions of the dual entropic relaxed optimal transport between the probabilities
  and a reference measure $\mathcal{U}$. We prove that this construction enables to
  obtain a valid kernel, by using the Hilbert norms. We prove that the kernel enjoys
  theoretical properties such as universality and some invariances, while still being
  computationally feasible. Moreover we provide theoretical guarantees on the behaviour
  of a Gaussian process based on this kernel. The empirical performances are compared
  with other traditional choices of kernels for processes indexed on distributions.
