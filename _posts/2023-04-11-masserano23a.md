title: 'Simulator-Based Inference with WALDO: Confidence Regions by Leveraging Prediction
  Algorithms and Posterior Estimators for Inverse Problems'
software: https://github.com/lee-group-cmu/lf2i
abstract: Prediction algorithms, such as deep neural networks (DNNs), are used in
  many domain sciences to directly estimate internal parameters of interest in simulator-based
  models, especially in settings where the observations include images or complex
  high-dimensional data. In parallel, modern neural density estimators, such as normalizing
  flows, are becoming increasingly popular for uncertainty quantification, especially
  when both parameters and observations are high-dimensional. However, parameter inference
  is an inverse problem and not a prediction task; thus, an open challenge is to construct
  conditionally valid and precise confidence regions, with a guaranteed probability
  of covering the true parameters of the data-generating process, no matter what the
  (unknown) parameter values are, and without relying on large-sample theory. Many
  simulator-based inference (SBI) methods are indeed known to produce biased or overly
  confident parameter regions, yielding misleading uncertainty estimates. This paper
  presents WALDO, a novel method to construct confidence regions with finite-sample
  conditional validity by leveraging prediction algorithms or posterior estimators
  that are currently widely adopted in SBI. WALDO reframes the well-known Wald test
  statistic, and uses a computationally efficient regression-based machinery for classical
  Neyman inversion of hypothesis tests. We apply our method to a recent high-energy
  physics problem, where prediction with DNNs has previously led to estimates with
  prediction bias. We also illustrate how our approach can correct overly confident
  posterior regions computed with normalizing flows.
