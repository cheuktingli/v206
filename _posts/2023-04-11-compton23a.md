title: Minimum-Entropy Coupling Approximation Guarantees Beyond the Majorization Barrier
abstract: 'Given a set of discrete probability distributions, the minimum entropy
  coupling is the minimum entropy joint distribution that has the input distributions
  as its marginals. This has immediate relevance to tasks such as entropic causal
  inference for causal graph discovery and bounding mutual information between variables
  that we observe separately. Since finding the minimum entropy coupling is NP-Hard,
  various works have studied approximation algorithms. The work of [Compton, 2022]
  shows that the greedy coupling algorithm of [Kocaoglu et al., 2017a] is always within
  $\log_2(e)$ $\approx$ 1.44 bits of the optimal coupling. Moreover, they show that
  it is impossible to obtain a better approximation guarantee using the majorization
  lower-bound that all prior works have used: thus establishing a majorization barrier.
  In this work, we break the majorization barrier by designing a stronger lower-bound
  that we call the profile method. Using this profile method, we are able to show
  that the greedy algorithm is always within $\log_2(e)/e$ $\approx$ 0.53 bits of
  optimal for coupling two distributions (previous best-known bound is within 1 bit),
  and within $(1 + \log_2(e))/2$ $\approx$ 1.22 bits for coupling any number of distributions
  (previous best-known bound is within 1.44 bits). We also examine a generalization
  of the minimum entropy coupling problem: Concave Minimum-Cost Couplings. We are
  able to obtain similar guarantees for this generalization in terms of the concave
  cost function. Additionally, we make progress on the open problem of [Kovačević
  et al., 2015] regarding NP membership of the minimum entropy coupling problem by
  showing that any hardness of minimum entropy coupling beyond NP comes from the difficulty
  of computing arithmetic in the complexity class NP. Finally, we present exponential-time
  algorithms for computing the exactly optimal solution. We experimentally observe
  that our new profile method lower bound is not only helpful for analyzing the greedy
  approximation algorithm, but also for improving the speed of our new backtracking-based
  exact algorithm.'
