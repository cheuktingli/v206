title: Data Augmentation for Imbalanced Regression
software: https://github.com/sstocksieker/DAIR
abstract: In this work, we consider the problem of imbalanced data in a regression
  framework when the imbalanced phenomenon concerns continuous or discrete covariates.
  Such a situation can lead to biases in the estimates. In this case, we propose a
  data augmentation algorithm that combines a weighted resampling (WR) and a data
  augmentation (DA) procedure. In a first step, the DA procedure permits exploring
  a wider support than the initial one. In a second step, the WR method drives the
  exogenous distribution to a target one. We discuss the choice of the DA procedure
  through a numerical study that illustrates the advantages of this approach. Finally,
  an actuarial application is studied.
