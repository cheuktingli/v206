title: Instance-dependent Sample Complexity Bounds for Zero-sum Matrix Games
abstract: 'We study the sample complexity of identifying an approximate equilibrium
  for two-player zero-sum $n\times 2$ matrix games. That is, in a sequence of repeated
  game plays, how many rounds must the two players play before reaching an approximate
  equilibrium (e.g., Nash)? We derive instance-dependent bounds that define an ordering
  over game matrices that captures the intuition that the dynamics of some games converge
  faster than others. Specifically, we consider a stochastic observation model such
  that when the two players choose actions $i$ and $j$, respectively, they both observe
  each otherâ€™s played actions and a stochastic observation $X_{ij}$ such that $\mathbb{E}[X_{ij}]
  = A_{ij}$. To our knowledge, our work is the first case of instance-dependent lower
  bounds on the number of rounds the players must play before reaching an approximate
  equilibrium in the sense that the number of rounds depends on the specific properties
  of the game matrix $A$ as well as the desired accuracy. We also prove a converse
  statement: there exist player strategies that achieve this lower bound.'
