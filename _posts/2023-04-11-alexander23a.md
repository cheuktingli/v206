title: Universal Agent Mixtures and the Geometry of Intelligence
abstract: 'Inspired by recent progress in multi-agent Reinforcement Learning (RL),
  in this work we examine the collective intelligent behaviour of theoretical universal
  agents by introducing a weighted mixture operation. Given a weighted set of agents,
  their weighted mixture is a new agent whose expected total reward in any environment
  is the corresponding weighted average of the original agents’ expected total rewards
  in that environment. Thus, if RL agent intelligence is quantified in terms of performance
  across environments, the weighted mixture’s intelligence is the weighted average
  of the original agents’ intelligence. This operation enables various interesting
  new theorems that shed light on the geometry of RL agent intelligence, namely: results
  about symmetries, convex agent-sets, and local extrema. We also show that any RL
  agent intelligence measure based on average performance across environments, subject
  to certain weak technical conditions, is identical (up to a constant factor) to
  performance within a single environment dependent on said intelligence measure.'
