title: Interactive Learning with Pricing for Optimal and Stable Allocations in Markets
abstract: 'Large-scale online recommendation systems must facilitate the allocation
  of a limited number of items among competing users while learning their preferences
  from user feedback. As a principled way of incorporating market constraints and
  user incentives in the design, we consider our objectives to be two-fold: maximal
  social welfare with minimal instability. To maximize social welfare, our proposed
  framework enhances the quality of recommendations by exploring allocations that
  optimistically maximize the rewards. To minimize instability, a measure of usersâ€™
  incentives to deviate from recommended allocations, the algorithm prices the items
  based on a scheme derived from the Walrasian equilibria. Though it is known that
  these equilibria yield stable prices for markets with known user preferences, our
  approach accounts for the inherent uncertainty in the preferences and further ensures
  that the users accept most of their recommendations under offered prices. To the
  best of our knowledge, our approach is the first to integrate techniques from combinatorial
  bandits, optimal resource allocation, and collaborative filtering to obtain an algorithm
  that achieves sub-linear social welfare regret as well as sub-linear instability.
  Empirical studies on synthetic and real-world data also demonstrate the efficacy
  of our strategy compared to approaches that do not fully incorporate all these aspects.'
