title: Further Adaptive Best-of-Both-Worlds Algorithm for Combinatorial Semi-Bandits
software: https://github.com/tsuchhiii/bobw-variance
abstract: We consider the combinatorial semi-bandit problem and present a new algorithm
  with a best-of-both-worlds regret guarantee; the regrets are bounded near-optimally
  in the stochastic and adversarial regimes. In the stochastic regime, we prove a
  variance-dependent regret bound depending on the tight suboptimality gap introduced
  by Kveton et al. (2015) with a good leading constant. In the adversarial regime,
  we show that the same algorithm simultaneously obtains various data-dependent regret
  bounds. Our algorithm is based on the follow-the-regularized-leader framework with
  a refined regularizer and adaptive learning rate. Finally, we numerically test the
  proposed algorithm and confirm its superior or competitive performance over existing
  algorithms, including Thompson sampling under most settings.
