title: Combining Graphical and Algebraic Approaches for Parameter Identification in
  Latent Variable Structural Equation Models
software: https://github.com/jtextor/dagitty/blob/master/r/R/dagitty.r
abstract: Measurement error is ubiquitous in many variables “latent-to-observed” (L2O)
  transformation from the MIIV approach and develop an equivalent graphical L2O transformation
  that allows applying existing graphical criteria to latent parameters in SEMs. We
  combine L2O transformation with graphical instrumental variable criteria to obtain
  an efficient algorithm for non-iterative parameter identification in SEMs with latent
  variables. We prove that this graphical L2O transformation with the instrumental
  set criterion is equivalent to the state-of-the-art MIIV approach for SEMs, and
  show that it can lead to novel identification strategies when combined with other
  graphical criteria.
