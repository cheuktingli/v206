title: Reinforcement Learning for Adaptive Mesh Refinement
abstract: Finite element simulations of physical systems governed by partial differential
  equations (PDE) crucially depend on adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) to allocate computational
  budget to regions where higher resolution is required. Existing scalable AMR methods
  make heuristic refinement decisions based on instantaneous error estimation and
  thus do not aim for long-term optimality over an entire simulation. We propose a
  novel formulation of AMR as a Markov decision process and apply deep reinforcement
  learning (RL) to train refinement policies directly from simulation. AMR poses a
  challenge for RL as both the state dimension and available action set changes at
  every step, which we solve by proposing new policy architectures with differing
  generality and inductive bias. The model sizes of these policy architectures are
  independent of the mesh size and hence can be deployed on larger simulations than
  those used at training time. We demonstrate in comprehensive experiments on static
  function estimation and time-dependent equations that RL policies can be trained
  on problems without using ground truth solutions, are competitive with a widely-used
  error estimator, and generalize to larger and unseen test problems.
