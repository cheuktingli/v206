title: From Shapley Values to Generalized Additive Models and back
software: https://github.com/tml-tuebingen/nshap
abstract: In explainable machine learning, local post-hoc explanation algorithms and
  inherently interpretable models are often seen as competing approaches. This work
  offers a partial reconciliation between the two by establishing a correspondence
  between Shapley Values and Generalized Additive Models (GAMs). We introduce $n$-Shapley
  Values, a parametric family of local post-hoc explanation algorithms that explain
  individual predictions with interaction terms up to order $n$. By varying the parameter
  $n$, we obtain a sequence of explanations that covers the entire range from Shapley
  Values up to a uniquely determined decomposition of the function we want to explain.
  The relationship between $n$-Shapley Values and this decomposition offers a functionally-grounded
  characterization of Shapley Values, which highlights their limitations. We then
  show that $n$-Shapley Values, as well as the Shapley Taylor- and Faith-Shap interaction
  indices, recover GAMs with interaction terms up to order $n$. This implies that
  the original Shapely Values recover GAMs without variable interactions. Taken together,
  our results provide a precise characterization of Shapley Values as they are being
  used in explainable machine learning. They also offer a principled interpretation
  of partial dependence plots of Shapley Values in terms of the underlying functional
  decomposition. A package for the estimation of different interaction indices is
  available at https://github.com/tml-tuebingen/nshap.
