title: Byzantine-Robust Federated Learning with Optimal Statistical Rates
software: https://github.com/wanglun1996/secure-robust-federated-learning
abstract: We propose Byzantine-robust federated learning protocols with nearly optimal
  statistical rates based on recent progress in high dimensional robust statistics.
  In contrast to prior work, our proposed protocols improve the dimension dependence
  and achieve a near-optimal statistical rate for strongly convex losses. We also
  provide statistical lower bound for the problem. For experiments, we benchmark against
  competing protocols and show the empirical superiority of the proposed protocols.
