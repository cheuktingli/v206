title: How Does Pseudo-Labeling Affect the Generalization Error of the Semi-Supervised
  Gibbs Algorithm?
abstract: We provide an exact characterization of the expected generalization error
  (gen-error) for semi-supervised learning (SSL) with pseudo-labeling via the Gibbs
  algorithm. The gen-error is expressed in terms of the symmetrized KL information
  between the output hypothesis, the pseudo-labeled dataset, and the labeled dataset.
  Distribution-free upper and lower bounds on the gen-error can also be obtained.
  Our findings offer new insights that the generalization performance of SSL with
  pseudo-labeling is affected not only by the information between the output hypothesis
  and input training data but also by the information shared between the labeled and
  pseudo-labeled data samples. This serves as a guideline to choose an appropriate
  pseudo-labeling method from a given family of methods. To deepen our understanding,
  we further explore two examplesâ€”mean estimation and logistic regression. In particular,
  we analyze how the ratio of the number of unlabeled to labeled data $\lambda$ affects
  the gen-error under both scenarios. As $\lambda$ increases, the gen-error for mean
  estimation decreases and then saturates at a value larger than when all the samples
  are labeled, and the gap can be quantified exactly with our analysis, and is dependent
  on the cross-covariance between the labeled and pseudo-labeled data samples. For
  logistic regression, the gen-error and the variance component of the excess risk
  also decrease as $\lambda$ increases.
