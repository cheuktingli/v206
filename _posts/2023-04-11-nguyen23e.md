title: Active Membership Inference Attack under Local Differential Privacy in Federated
  Learning
software: https://github.com/trucndt/ami
abstract: Federated learning (FL) was originally regarded as a framework for collaborative
  learning among clients with data privacy protection through a coordinating server.
  In this paper, we propose a new active membership inference (AMI) attack carried
  out by a dishonest server in FL. In AMI attacks, the server crafts and embeds malicious
  parameters into global models to effectively infer whether a target data sample
  is included in a client’s private training data or not. By exploiting the correlation
  among data features through a non-linear decision boundary, AMI attacks with a certified
  guarantee of success can achieve severely high success rates under rigorous local
  differential privacy (LDP) protection; thereby exposing clients’ training data to
  significant privacy risk. Theoretical and experimental results on several benchmark
  datasets show that adding sufficient privacy-preserving noise to prevent our attack
  would significantly damage FL’s model utility.
