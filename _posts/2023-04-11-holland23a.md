title: Flexible risk design using bi-directional dispersion
software: https://github.com/feedbackward/bdd
abstract: Many novel notions of “risk” (e.g., CVaR, tilted risk, DRO risk) have been
  proposed and studied, but these risks are all at least as sensitive as the mean
  to loss tails on the upside, and tend to ignore deviations on the downside. We study
  a complementary new risk class that penalizes loss deviations in a bi-directional
  manner, while having more flexibility in terms of tail sensitivity than is offered
  by mean-variance. This class lets us derive high-probability learning guarantees
  without explicit gradient clipping, and empirical tests using both simulated and
  real data illustrate a high degree of control over key properties of the test loss
  distribution of gradient-based learners.
