title: Improving Adaptive Conformal Prediction Using Self-Supervised Learning
software: https://github.com/vanderschaarlab/SSCP
abstract: Conformal prediction is a powerful distribution-free tool for uncertainty
  quantification, establishing valid prediction intervals with finite-sample guarantees.
  To produce valid intervals which are also adaptive to the difficulty of each instance,
  a common approach is to compute normalized nonconformity scores on a separate calibration
  set. Self-supervised learning has been effectively utilized in many domains to learn
  general representations for downstream predictors. However, the use of self-supervision
  beyond model pretraining and representation learning has been largely unexplored.
  In this work, we investigate how self-supervised pretext tasks can improve the quality
  of the conformal regressors, specifically by improving the adaptability of conformal
  intervals. We train an auxiliary model with a self-supervised pretext task on top
  of an existing predictive model and use the self-supervised error as an additional
  feature to estimate nonconformity scores. We empirically demonstrate the benefit
  of the additional information using both synthetic and real data on the efficiency
  (width), deficit, and excess of conformal prediction intervals.
