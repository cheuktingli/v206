title: Preferential Subsampling for Stochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics
software: https://github.com/srshtiputcha/sgmcmc_preferential_subsampling
abstract: Stochastic gradient MCMC (SGMCMC) offers a scalable alternative to traditional
  MCMC, by constructing an unbiased estimate of the gradient of the log-posterior
  with a small, uniformly-weighted subsample of the data. While efficient to compute,
  the resulting gradient estimator may exhibit a high variance and impact sampler
  performance. The problem of variance control has been traditionally addressed by
  constructing a better stochastic gradient estimator, often using control variates.
  We propose to use a discrete, non-uniform probability distribution to preferentially
  subsample data points that have a greater impact on the stochastic gradient. In
  addition, we present a method of adaptively adjusting the subsample size at each
  iteration of the algorithm, so that we increase the subsample size in areas of the
  sample space where the gradient is harder to estimate. We demonstrate that such
  an approach can maintain the same level of accuracy while substantially reducing
  the average subsample size that is used.
