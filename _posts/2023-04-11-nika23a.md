title: Online Defense Strategies for Reinforcement Learning Against Adaptive Reward
  Poisoning
abstract: We consider the problem of defense against reward-poisoning attacks in reinforcement
  learning and formulate it as a game in $T$ rounds between a defender and an adaptive
  attacker in an adversarial environment. To address this problem, we design two novel
  defense algorithms. First, we propose Exp3-DARP, a defense algorithm that uses Exp3
  as a hyperparameter learning subroutine, and show that it achieves order-optimal
  $\tilde{\Theta}(T^{1/2})$ bounds on our notion of regret with respect to a defense
  that always picks the optimal parameter in hindsight. We show that the order of
  $T$ in the bounds cannot be improved when the reward arrival process is adversarial,
  even if the feedback model of the defense is stronger. However, assuming that the
  environment is stochastic, we propose OMDUCB-DARP that uses estimates of costs as
  proxies to update the randomized strategy of the learner and are able to substantially
  improve the bounds proportional to how smoothly the attackerâ€™s strategy changes.
  Furthermore, we show that weaker types of defense, that do not take into account
  the attack structure and the poisoned rewards, suffer linear regret with respect
  to a defender that always selects the optimal parameter in hindsight when faced
  with an adaptive attacker that uses a no-regret algorithm to learn the behavior
  of the defense. Finally, we support our theoretical results with experimental evaluations
  on three different environments, showcasing the efficiency of our methods.
