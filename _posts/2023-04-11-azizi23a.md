title: Overcoming Prior Misspecification in Online Learning to Rank
abstract: The recent literature on online learning to rank (LTR) has established the
  utility of prior knowledge to Bayesian ranking bandit algorithms. However, a major
  limitation of existing work is the requirement for the prior used by the algorithm
  to match the true prior. In this paper, we propose and analyze adaptive algorithms
  that address this issue and additionally extend these results to the linear and
  generalized linear models. We also consider scalar relevance feedback on top of
  click feedback. Moreover, we demonstrate the efficacy of our algorithms using both
  synthetic and real-world experiments.
