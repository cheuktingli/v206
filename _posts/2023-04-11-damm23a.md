title: The ELBO of Variational Autoencoders Converges to a Sum of Entropies
software: https://github.com/Learning-with-Entropies
abstract: 'The central objective function of a variational autoencoder (VAE) is its
  variational lower bound (the ELBO). Here we show that for standard (i.e., Gaussian)
  VAEs the ELBO converges to a value given by the sum of three entropies: the (negative)
  entropy of the prior distribution, the expected (negative) entropy of the observable
  distribution, and the average entropy of the variational distributions (the latter
  is already part of the ELBO). Our derived analytical results are exact and apply
  for small as well as for intricate deep networks for encoder and decoder. Furthermore,
  they apply for finitely and infinitely many data points and at any stationary point
  (including local maxima and saddle points). The result implies that the ELBO can
  for standard VAEs often be computed in closed-form at stationary points while the
  original ELBO requires numerical approximations of integrals. As a main contribution,
  we provide the proof that the ELBO for VAEs is at stationary points equal to entropy
  sums. Numerical experiments then show that the obtained analytical results are sufficiently
  precise also in those vicinities of stationary points that are reached in practice.
  Furthermore, we discuss how the novel entropy form of the ELBO can be used to analyze
  and understand learning behavior. More generally, we believe that our contributions
  can be useful for future theoretical and practical studies on VAE learning as they
  provide novel information on those points in parameters space that optimization
  of VAEs converges to.'
