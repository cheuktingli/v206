title: 'Smoothly Giving up: Robustness for Simple Models'
software: https://github.com/SankarLab/Giving-Up
abstract: There is a growing need for models that are interpretable and have reduced
  energy/computational cost (e.g., in health care analytics and federated learning).
  Examples of algorithms to train such models include logistic regression and boosting.
  However, one challenge facing these algorithms is that they provably suffer from
  label noise; this has been attributed to the joint interaction between oft-used
  convex loss functions and simpler hypothesis classes, resulting in too much emphasis
  being placed on outliers. In this work, we use the margin-based $\alpha$-loss, which
  continuously tunes between canonical convex and quasi-convex losses, to robustly
  train simple models. We show that the $\alpha$ hyperparameter smoothly introduces
  non-convexity and offers the benefit of “giving up” on noisy training examples.
  We also provide results on the Long-Servedio dataset for boosting and a COVID-19
  survey dataset for logistic regression, highlighting the efficacy of our approach
  across multiple relevant domains.
