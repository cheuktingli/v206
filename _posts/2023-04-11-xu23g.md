title: On the Accelerated Noise-Tolerant Power Method
software: https://github.com/zhiqiangxu2001/ANPM
abstract: We revisit the acceleration of the noise-tolerant power method for which,
  despite previous studies, the results remain unsatisfactory as they are either wrong
  or suboptimal, also lacking generality. In this work, we present a simple yet general
  and optimal analysis via noise-corrupted Chebyshev polynomials, which allows a larger
  iteration rank $p$ than the target rank $k$, requires less noise conditions in a
  new form, and achieves the optimal iteration complexity $\Theta\left(\sqrt{\frac{\lambda_{k}-\lambda_{q+1}}{\lambda_{k}}}\log\frac{1}{\epsilon}\right)$
  for some $q$ satisfying $k\leq q\leq p$ in a certain regime of the momentum parameter.
  Interestingly, it shows dynamic dependence of the noise tolerance on the spectral
  gap, i.e., from linear at the beginning to square-root near convergence, while remaining
  commensurate with the previous in terms of overall tolerance. We relate our new
  form of noise norm conditions to the existing trigonometric one, which enables an
  improved analysis of generalized eigenspace computation and canonical correlation
  analysis. We conduct an extensive experimental study to showcase the great performance
  of the considered algorithm with a larger iteration rank $p>k$ across different
  applications.
