title: Continuous-Time Decision Transformer for Healthcare Applications
software: https://github.com/ZhiyueZ/CTDT
abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) is a promising approach for training
  intelligent medical agents to learn treatment policies and assist decision making
  in many healthcare applications, such as scheduling clinical visits and assigning
  dosages for patients with chronic conditions. In this paper, we investigate the
  potential usefulness of Decision Transformer (Chen et al., 2021)–a new offline RL
  paradign–  in medical domains where decision making in continuous time is desired.
  As Decision Transformer only handles discrete-time (or turn-based) sequential decision
  making scenarios, we generalize it to Continuous-Time Decision Transformer that
  not only considers the past clinical measurements and treatments but also the timings
  of previous visits, and learns to suggest the timings of future visits as well as
  the treatment plan at each visit. Extensive experiments on synthetic datasets and
  simulators motivated by real-world medical applications demonstrate that Continuous-Time
  Decision Transformer is able to outperform competitors and has clinical utility
  in terms of improving patients’ health and prolonging their survival by learning
  high-performance policies from logged data generated using policies of different
  levels of quality.
