title: Strong Lottery Ticket Hypothesis with $\varepsilon$–perturbation
software: https://github.com/edixiong/slth-eps
abstract: 'The strong Lottery Ticket Hypothesis (LTH) (Ramanujan et al., 2019; Zhou
  et al., 2019) claims the existence of a subnetwork in a sufficiently large, randomly
  initialized neural network that approximates some target neural network without
  the need of training. We extend the theoretical guarantee of the strong LTH literature
  to a scenario more similar to the original LTH, by generalizing the weight change
  in the pre-training step to some perturbation around initialization. In particular,
  we focus on the following open questions: By allowing an $\varepsilon$-scale perturbation
  on the random initial weights, can we reduce the over-parameterization requirement
  for the candidate network in the strong LTH? Furthermore, does the weight change
  by SGD coincide with a good set of such perturbation? We answer the first question
  by first extending the theoretical result on subset sum problem (Lueker, 1998) to
  allow perturbation on the candidates. Applying this result to the neural network
  setting, we show that by allowing $\varepsilon$-scale perturbation, we can reduce
  the over-parameterization requirement of the strong LTH by a factor of $O(1/(1+\varepsilon))$.
  To answer the second question, we show via experiments that the perturbed weight
  achieved by the projected SGD shows better performance under the strong LTH pruning.'
