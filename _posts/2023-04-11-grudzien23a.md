title: Can 5th Generation Local Training Methods Support Client Sampling? Yes!
abstract: 'The celebrated FedAvg algorithm of McMahan et al. (2017) is based on three
  components: client sampling (CS), data sampling (DS) and local training (LT). While
  the first two are reasonably well understood, the third component, whose role is
  to reduce the number of communication rounds needed to train the model, resisted
  all attempts at a satisfactory theoretical explanation. Malinovsky et al. (2022)
  identified four distinct generations of LT methods based on the quality of the provided
  theoretical communication complexity guarantees. Despite a lot of progress in this
  area, none of the existing works were able to show that it is theoretically better
  to employ multiple local gradient-type steps (i.e., to engage in LT) than to rely
  on a single local gradient-type step only in the important heterogeneous data regime.
  In a recent breakthrough embodied in their ProxSkip method and its theoretical analysis,
  Mishchenko et al. (2022) showed that LT indeed leads to provable communication acceleration
  for arbitrarily heterogeneous data, thus jump-starting the 5th generation of LT
  methods. However, while these latest generation LT methods are compatible with DS,
  none of them support CS. We resolve this open problem in the affirmative. In order
  to do so, we had to base our algorithmic development on new algorithmic and theoretical
  foundations.'
