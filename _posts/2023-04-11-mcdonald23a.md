title: Nonparametric Gaussian Process Covariances via Multidimensional Convolutions
software: https://github.com/magnusross/npcgp
abstract: 'A key challenge in the practical application of Gaussian processes (GPs)
  is selecting a proper covariance function. The process convolutions construction
  of GPs allows some additional flexibility, but still requires choosing a proper
  smoothing kernel, which is non-trivial. Previous approaches have built covariance
  functions by using GP priors over the smoothing kernel, and by extension the covariance,
  as a way to bypass the need to specify it in advance. However, these models have
  been limited in several ways: they are restricted to single dimensional inputs,
  e.g. time; they only allow modelling of single outputs and they do not scale to
  large datasets since inference is not straightforward. In this paper, we introduce
  a nonparametric process convolution formulation for GPs that alleviates these weaknesses.
  We achieve this using a functional sampling approach based on Matheron’s rule to
  perform fast sampling using interdomain inducing variables. We test the performance
  of our model on benchmarks for single output, multi-output and large-scale GP regression,
  and find that our approach can provide improvements over standard GP models, particularly
  for larger datasets.'
