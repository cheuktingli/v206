title: 'A Sea of Words: An In-Depth Analysis of Anchors for Text Data'
software: https://github.com/gianluigilopardo/anchors_text_theory
abstract: Anchors (Ribeiro et al., 2018) is a post-hoc, rule-based interpretability
  method. For text data, it proposes to explain a decision by highlighting a small
  set of words (an anchor) such that the model to explain has similar outputs when
  they are present in a document. In this paper, we present the first theoretical
  analysis of Anchors, considering that the search for the best anchor is exhaustive.
  After formalizing the algorithm for text classification, we present explicit results
  on different classes of models when the vectorization step is TF-IDF, and words
  are replaced by a fixed out-of-dictionary token when removed. Our inquiry covers
  models such as elementary if-then rules and linear classifiers. We then leverage
  this analysis to gain insights on the behavior of Anchors for any differentiable
  classifiers. For neural networks, we empirically show that the words corresponding
  to the highest partial derivatives of the model with respect to the input, reweighted
  by the inverse document frequencies, are selected by Anchors.
