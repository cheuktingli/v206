title: Learning Physics-Informed Neural Networks without Stacked Back-propagation
software: https://github.com/LithiumDA/PINN-without-Stacked-BP
abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) has become a commonly used machine
  learning approach to solve partial differential equations (PDE). But, facing high-dimensional
  secondorder PDE problems, PINN will suffer from severe scalability issues since
  its loss includes second-order derivatives, the computational cost of which will
  grow along with the dimension during stacked back-propagation. In this work, we
  develop a novel approach that can significantly accelerate the training of Physics-Informed
  Neural Networks. In particular, we parameterize the PDE solution by the Gaussian
  smoothed model and show that, derived from Steinâ€™s Identity, the second-order derivatives
  can be efficiently calculated without back-propagation. We further discuss the model
  capacity and provide variance reduction methods to address key limitations in the
  derivative estimation. Experimental results show that our proposed method can achieve
  competitive error compared to standard PINN training but is significantly faster.
