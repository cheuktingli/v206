title: Estimating Total Correlation with Mutual Information Estimators
software: https://github.com/Linear95/TC-estimation
abstract: Total correlation (TC) is a fundamental concept in information theory that
  measures statistical dependency among multiple random variables. Recently, TC has
  shown noticeable effectiveness as a regularizer in many learning tasks, where the
  correlation among multiple latent embeddings requires to be jointly minimized or
  maximized. However, calculating precise TC values is challenging, especially when
  the closed-form distributions of embedding variables are unknown. In this paper,
  we introduce a unified framework to estimate total correlation values with sample-based
  mutual information (MI) estimators. More specifically, we discover a relation between
  TC and MI and propose two types of calculation paths (tree-like and line-like) to
  decompose TC into MI terms. With each MI term being bounded, the TC values can be
  successfully estimated. Further, we provide theoretical analyses concerning the
  statistical consistency of the proposed TC estimators. Experiments are presented
  on both synthetic and real-world scenarios, where our estimators demonstrate effectiveness
  in all TC estimation, minimization, and maximization tasks.
