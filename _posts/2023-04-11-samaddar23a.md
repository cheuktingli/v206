title: Sparsity-Inducing Categorical Prior Improves Robustness of the Information
  Bottleneck
software: https://github.com/AnirbanSamaddar/SparC-IB
abstract: The information bottleneck framework provides a systematic approach to learning
  representations that compress nuisance information in the input and extract semantically
  meaningful information about predictions. However, the choice of a prior distribution
  that fixes the dimensionality across all the data can restrict the flexibility of
  this approach for learning robust representations. We present a novel sparsity-inducing
  spike-slab categorical prior that uses sparsity as a mechanism to provide the flexibility
  that allows each data point to learn its own dimension distribution. In addition,
  it provides a mechanism for learning a joint distribution of the latent variable
  and the sparsity, and hence it can account for the complete uncertainty in the latent
  space. Through a series of experiments using in-distribution and out-of-distribution
  learning scenarios on the MNIST, CIFAR-10, and ImageNet data, we show that the proposed
  approach improves accuracy and robustness compared to traditional fixed-dimensional
  priors, as well as other sparsity induction mechanisms for latent variable models
  proposed in the literature.
