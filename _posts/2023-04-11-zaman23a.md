title: Oracle-free Reinforcement Learning in Mean-Field Games along a Single Sample
  Path
abstract: We consider online reinforcement learning in Mean-Field Games (MFGs). Unlike
  traditional approaches, we alleviate the need for a mean-field oracle by developing
  an algorithm that approximates the Mean-Field Equilibrium (MFE) using the single
  sample path of the generic agent. We call this Sandbox Learning, as it can be used
  as a warm-start for any agent learning in a multi-agent non-cooperative setting.
  We adopt a two time-scale approach in which an online fixed-point recursion for
  the mean-field operates on a slower time-scale, in tandem with a control policy
  update on a faster time-scale for the generic agent. Given that the underlying Markov
  Decision Process (MDP) of the agent is communicating, we provide finite sample convergence
  guarantees in terms of convergence of the mean-field and control policy to the mean-field
  equilibrium. The sample complexity of the Sandbox learning algorithm is $O(\epsilon^{-4})$
  where $\epsilon$ is the MFE approximation error. This is similar to works which
  assume access to oracle. Finally, we empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of
  the sandbox learning algorithm in diverse scenarios, including those where the MDP
  does not necessarily have a single communicating class.
