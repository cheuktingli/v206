title: Gradient-Informed Neural Network Statistical Robustness Estimation
software: https://github.com/karimtito/stat_reliability_measure
abstract: Deep neural networks are robust against random corruptions of the inputs
  to some extent. This global sense of safety is not sufficient in critical applications
  where probabilities of failure must be assessed with accuracy. Some previous works
  applied known statistical methods from the field of rare event analysis to classification.
  Yet, they use classifiers as black-box models without taking into account gradient
  information, readily available for deep learning models via auto-differentiation.
  We propose a new and highly efficient estimator of probabilities of failure dedicated
  to neural networks as it leverages the fast computation of gradients of the model
  through back-propagation.
