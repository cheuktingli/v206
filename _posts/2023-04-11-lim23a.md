title: Energy-Based Models for Functional Data using Path Measure Tilting
software: https://github.com/jenninglim/functional-ebm
abstract: Energy-Based Models (EBMs) have proven to be a highly effective approach
  for modelling densities on finite-dimensional spaces. Their ability to incorporate
  domain-specific choices and constraints into the structure of the model through
  composition make EBMs an appealing candidate for applications in physics, biology
  and computer vision and various other fields. Recently, Energy-Based Processes (EBP)
  for modelling stochastic processes was proposed for unconditional exchangeable data
  (e.g., point clouds). In this work, we present a novel subclass of EBPs, called
  $\mathcal{F}$-EBM for conditional exchangeable data, which is able to learn distributions
  of functions (such as curves or surfaces) from functional samples evaluated at finitely
  many points. Two unique challenges arise in the functional context. Firstly, training
  data is often not evaluated along a fixed set of points. Secondly, steps must be
  taken to control the behaviour of the model between evaluation points, to mitigate
  overfitting. The proposed model is an energy based model on function space that
  is decomposed spectrally, where a Gaussian Process path measure is used to reweight
  the distribution to capture smoothness properties of the underlying process being
  modelled. The resulting model has the ability to utilize irregularly sampled training
  data and can output predictions at any resolution, providing an effective approach
  to up-scaling functional data. We demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed approach
  for modelling a range of datasets, including data collected from Standard and Poorâ€™s
  500 (S$&$P) and UK National grid.
