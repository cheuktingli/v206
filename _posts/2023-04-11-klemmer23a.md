title: Positional Encoder Graph Neural Networks for Geographic Data
software: https://github.com/konstantinklemmer/pe-gnn
abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) provide a powerful and scalable solution for
  modeling continuous spatial data. However, they often rely on Euclidean distances
  to construct the input graphs. This assumption can be improbable in many real-world
  settings, where the spatial structure is more complex and explicitly non-Euclidean
  (e.g., road networks). Here, we propose PE-GNN, a new framework that incorporates
  spatial context and correlation explicitly into the models. Building on recent advances
  in geospatial auxiliary task learning and semantic spatial embeddings, our proposed
  method (1) learns a context-aware vector encoding of the geographic coordinates
  and (2) predicts spatial autocorrelation in the data in parallel with the main task.
  On spatial interpolation and regression tasks, we show the effectiveness of our
  approach, improving performance over different state-of-the-art GNN approaches.
  We observe that our approach not only vastly improves over the GNN baselines, but
  can match Gaussian processes, the most commonly utilized method for spatial interpolation
  problems.
