abstract: Data valuation has wide use cases in machine learning, including improving
  data quality and creating economic incentives for data sharing. This paper studies
  the robustness of data valuation to noisy model performance scores. Particularly,
  we find that the inherent randomness of the widely used stochastic gradient descent
  can cause existing data value notions (e.g., the Shapley value and the Leave-one-out
  error) to produce inconsistent data value rankings across different runs. To address
  this challenge, we introduce the concept of safety margin, which measures the robustness
  of a data value notion. We show that the Banzhaf value, a famous value notion that
  originated from cooperative game theory literature, achieves the largest safety
  margin among all semivalues (a class of value notions that satisfy crucial properties
  entailed by ML applications and include the famous Shapley value and Leave-one-out
  error). We propose an algorithm to efficiently estimate the Banzhaf value based
  on the Maximum Sample Reuse (MSR) principle. Our evaluation demonstrates that the
  Banzhaf value outperforms the existing semivalue-based data value notions on several
  ML tasks such as learning with weighted samples and noisy label detection. Overall,
  our study suggests that when the underlying ML algorithm is stochastic, the Banzhaf
  value is a promising alternative to the other semivalue-based data value schemes
  given its computational advantage and ability to robustly differentiate data quality.
