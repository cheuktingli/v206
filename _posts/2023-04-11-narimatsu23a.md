title: Collision Probability Matching Loss for Disentangling Epistemic Uncertainty
  from Aleatoric Uncertainty
software: https://github.com/nttcslab/collision-probability-matching
abstract: Two important aspects of machine learning, uncertainty and calibration,
  have previously been studied separately. The first aspect involves knowing whether
  inaccuracy is due to the epistemic uncertainty of the model, which is theoretically
  reducible, or to the aleatoric uncertainty in the data per se, which thus becomes
  the upper bound of model performance. As for the second aspect, numerous calibration
  methods have been proposed to correct predictive probabilities to better reflect
  the true probabilities of being correct. In this paper, we aim to obtain the squared
  error of predictive distribution from the true distribution as epistemic uncertainty.
  Our formulation, based on second-order RÃ©nyi entropy, integrates the two problems
  into a unified framework and obtains the epistemic (un)certainty as the difference
  between the aleatoric and predictive (un)certainties. As an auxiliary loss to ordinary
  losses, such as cross-entropy loss, the proposed collision probability matching
  (CPM) loss matches the cross-collision probability between the true and predictive
  distributions to the collision probability of the predictive distribution, where
  these probabilities correspond to accuracy and confidence, respectively. Unlike
  previous Shannon-entropy-based uncertainty methods, the proposed method makes the
  aleatoric uncertainty directly measurable as test-retest reliability, which is a
  summary statistic of the true distribution frequently used in scientific research
  on humans. We provide mathematical proof and strong experimental evidence for our
  formulation using both a real dataset consisting of real human ratings toward emotional
  faces and simulation.
