title: 'EEGNN: Edge Enhanced Graph Neural Network with a Bayesian Nonparametric Graph
  Model'
abstract: Training deep graph neural networks (GNNs) poses a challenging task, as
  the performance of GNNs may suffer from the number of hidden message-passing layers.
  The literature has focused on the proposals of over-smoothing and under-reaching
  to explain the performance deterioration of deep GNNs. In this paper, we propose
  a new explanation for such deteriorated performance phenomenon, mis-simplification,
  that is, mistakenly simplifying graphs by preventing self-loops and forcing edges
  to be unweighted. We show that such simplifying can reduce the potential of message-passing
  layers to capture the structural information of graphs. In view of this, we propose
  a new framework, edge enhanced graph neural network (EEGNN). EEGNN uses the structural
  information extracted from the proposed Dirichlet mixture Poisson graph model (DMPGM),
  a Bayesian nonparametric model for graphs, to improve the performance of various
  deep message-passing GNNs. We propose a Markov chain Monte Carlo inference framework
  for DMPGM. Experiments over different datasets show that our method achieves considerable
  performance increase compared to baselines.
