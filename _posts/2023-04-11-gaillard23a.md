title: 'One Arrow, Two Kills: A Unified Framework for Achieving Optimal Regret Guarantees
  in Sleeping Bandits'
software: https://github.com/sdan2/Internal-Regret-Bandits
abstract: We address the problem of Internal Regret in adversarial Sleeping Bandits
  and the relationship between different notions of sleeping regrets in multi-armed
  bandits. We propose a new concept called Internal Regret for sleeping multi-armed
  bandits (MAB) and present an algorithm that achieves sublinear Internal Regret,
  even when losses and availabilities are both adversarial. We demonstrate that a
  low internal regret leads to both low external regret and low policy regret for
  i.i.d. losses. Our contribution is unifying existing notions of regret in sleeping
  bandits and exploring their implications for each other. In addition, we extend
  our results to Dueling Bandits (DB), a preference feedback version of multi-armed
  bandits, and design a low-regret algorithm for sleeping dueling bandits with stochastic
  preferences and adversarial availabilities. We validate the effectiveness of our
  algorithms through empirical evaluations.
