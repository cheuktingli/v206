title: Faithful Heteroscedastic Regression with Neural Networks
software: https://github.com/astirn/faithful-heteroscedasticity
abstract: Heteroscedastic regression models a Gaussian variable’s mean and variance
  as a function of covariates. Parametric methods that employ neural networks for
  these parameter maps can capture complex relationships in the data. Yet, optimizing
  network parameters via log likelihood gradients can yield suboptimal mean and uncalibrated
  variance estimates. Current solutions side-step this optimization problem with surrogate
  objectives or Bayesian treatments. Instead, we make two simple modifications to
  optimization. Notably, their combination produces a heteroscedastic model with mean
  estimates that are provably as accurate as those from its homoscedastic counterpart
  (i.e. fitting the mean under squared error loss). For a wide variety of network
  and task complexities, we find that mean estimates from existing heteroscedastic
  solutions can be significantly less accurate than those from an equivalently expressive
  mean-only model. Our approach provably retains the accuracy of an equally flexible
  mean-only model while also offering best-in-class variance calibration. Lastly,
  we show how to leverage our method to recover the underlying heteroscedastic noise
  variance.
