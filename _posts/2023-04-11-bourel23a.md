title: Exploration in Reward Machines with Low Regret
software: https://github.com/HippolyteBourel/UCRL-RM
abstract: We study reinforcement learning (RL) for decision processes with non-Markovian
  reward, in which high-level knowledge in the form of reward machines is available
  to the learner. Specifically, we investigate the efficiency of RL under the average-reward
  criterion, in the regret minimization setting. We propose two model-based RL algorithms
  that each exploits the structure of the reward machines, and show that our algorithms
  achieve regret bounds that improve over those of baselines by a multiplicative factor
  proportional to the number of states in the underlying reward machine. To the best
  of our knowledge, the proposed algorithms and associated regret bounds are the first
  to tailor the analysis specifically to reward machines, either in the episodic or
  average-reward settings. We also present a regret lower bound for the studied setting,
  which indicates that the proposed algorithms achieve a near-optimal regret. Finally,
  we report numerical experiments that demonstrate the superiority of the proposed
  algorithms over existing baselines in practice.
