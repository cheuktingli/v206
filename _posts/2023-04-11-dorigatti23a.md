title: Frequentist Uncertainty Quantification in Semi-Structured Neural Networks
abstract: Semi-structured regression (SSR) models jointly learn the effect of structured
  (tabular) and unstructured (non-tabular) data through additive predictors and deep
  neural networks (DNNs), respectively. Inference in SSR models aims at deriving confidence
  intervals for the structured predictor, although current approaches ignore the variance
  of the DNN estimation of the unstructured effects. This results in an underestimation
  of the variance of the structured coefficients and, thus, an increase of Type-I
  error rates. To address this shortcoming, we present here a theoretical framework
  for structured inference in SSR models that incorporates the variance of the DNN
  estimate into confidence intervals for the structured predictor. By treating this
  estimate as a random offset with known variance, our formulation is agnostic to
  the specific deep uncertainty quantification method employed. Through numerical
  experiments and a practical application on a medical dataset, we show that our approach
  results in increased coverage of the true structured coefficients and thus a reduction
  in Type-I error rate compared to ignoring the variance of the neural network, naive
  ensembling of SSR models, and a variational inference baseline.
