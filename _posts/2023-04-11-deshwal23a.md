title: Bayesian Optimization over High-Dimensional Combinatorial Spaces via Dictionary-based
  Embeddings
software: https://github.com/aryandeshwal/BODi
abstract: We consider the problem of optimizing expensive black-box functions over
  high-dimensional combinatorial spaces which arises in many science, engineering,
  and ML applications. We use Bayesian Optimization (BO) and propose a novel surrogate
  modeling approach for efficiently handling a large number of binary and categorical
  parameters. The key idea is to select a number of discrete structures from the input
  space (the dictionary) and use them to define an ordinal embedding for high-dimensional
  combinatorial structures. This allows us to use existing Gaussian process models
  for continuous spaces. We develop a principled approach based on binary wavelets
  to construct dictionaries for binary spaces, and propose a randomized construction
  method that generalizes to categorical spaces. We provide theoretical justification
  to support the effectiveness of the dictionary-based embeddings. Our experiments
  on diverse real-world benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed surrogate
  modeling approach over state-of-the-art BO methods.
