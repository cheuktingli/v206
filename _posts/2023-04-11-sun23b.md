title: 'Uni6Dv2: Noise Elimination for 6D Pose Estimation'
abstract: Uni6D is the first 6D pose estimation approach to employ a unified backbone
  network to extract features from both RGB and depth images. We discover that the
  principal reasons of Uni6D performance limitations are Instance-Outside and Instance-Inside
  noise. Uni6Dâ€™s simple pipeline design inherently introduces Instance-Outside noise
  from background pixels in the receptive field, while ignoring Instance-Inside noise
  in the input depth data. In this paper, we propose a two-step denoising approach
  for dealing with the aforementioned noise in Uni6D. To reduce noise from non-instance
  regions, an instance segmentation network is utilized in the first step to crop
  and mask the instance. A lightweight depth denoising module is proposed in the second
  step to calibrate the depth feature before feeding it into the pose regression network.
  Extensive experiments show that our Uni6Dv2 reliably and robustly eliminates noise,
  outperforming Uni6D without sacrificing too much inference efficiency. It also reduces
  the need for annotated real data that requires costly labeling.
