title: On Universal Portfolios with Continuous Side Information
abstract: A new portfolio selection strategy that adapts to a continuous side-information
  sequence is presented, with a universal wealth guarantee against a class of state-constant
  rebalanced portfolios with respect to a state function that maps each side-information
  symbol to a finite set of states. In particular, given that a state function belongs
  to a collection of functions of finite Natarajan dimension, the proposed strategy
  is shown to achieve, asymptotically to first order in the exponent, the same wealth
  as the best state-constant rebalanced portfolio with respect to the best state function,
  chosen in hindsight from observed market. This result can be viewed as an extension
  of the seminal work of Cover and Ordentlich (1996) that assumes a single-state function.
