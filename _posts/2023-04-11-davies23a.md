title: Transport Reversible Jump Proposals
software: https://github.com/daviesl/trjp
abstract: Reversible jump Markov chain Monte Carlo (RJMCMC) proposals that achieve
  reasonable acceptance rates and mixing are notoriously difficult to design in most
  applications. Inspired by recent advances in deep neural network-based normalizing
  flows and density estimation, we demonstrate an approach to enhance the efficiency
  of RJMCMC sampling by performing transdimensional jumps involving reference distributions.
  In contrast to other RJMCMC proposals, the proposed method is the first to apply
  a non-linear transport-based approach to construct efficient proposals between models
  with complicated dependency structures. It is shown that, in the setting where exact
  transports are used, our RJMCMC proposals have the desirable property that the acceptance
  probability depends only on the model probabilities. Numerical experiments demonstrate
  the efficacy of the approach.
