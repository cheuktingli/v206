title: Byzantine-Robust Online and Offline Distributed Reinforcement Learning
abstract: We consider a distributed reinforcement learning setting where multiple
  agents separately explore the environment and communicate their experiences through
  a central server. However, $\alpha$-fraction of agents are adversarial and can report
  arbitrary fake information. Critically, these adversarial agents can collude and
  their fake data can be of any sizes. We desire to robustly identify a near-optimal
  policy for the underlying Markov decision process in the presence of these adversarial
  agents. Our main technical contribution is COW, a novel algorithm for the robust
  mean estimation from batches problem, that can handle arbitrary batch sizes. Building
  upon this new estimator, in the offline setting, we design a Byzantine-robust distributed
  pessimistic value iteration algorithm; in the online setting, we design a Byzantine-robust
  distributed optimistic value iteration algorithm. Both algorithms obtain near-optimal
  sample complexities and achieve superior robustness guarantee than prior works.
