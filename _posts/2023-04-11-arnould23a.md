title: Is interpolation benign for random forest regression?
abstract: 'Statistical wisdom suggests that very complex models, interpolating training
  data, will be poor at predicting unseen examples. Yet, this aphorism has been recently
  challenged by the identification of benign overfitting regimes, specially studied
  in the case of parametric models: generalization capabilities may be preserved despite
  model high complexity. While it is widely known that fully-grown decision trees
  interpolate and, in turn, have bad predictive performances, the same behavior is
  yet to be analyzed for Random Forests (RF). In this paper, we study the trade-off
  between interpolation and consistency for several types of RF algorithms. Theoretically,
  we prove that interpolation regimes and consistency cannot be achieved simultaneously
  for several non-adaptive RF. Since adaptivity seems to be the cornerstone to bring
  together interpolation and consistency, we study interpolating Median RF which are
  proved to be consistent in the interpolating regime. This is the first result conciliating
  interpolation and consistency for RF, highlighting that the averaging effect introduced
  by feature randomization is a key mechanism, sufficient to ensure the consistency
  in the interpolation regime and beyond. Numerical experiments show that Breimanâ€™s
  RF are consistent while exactly interpolating, when no bootstrap step is involved.
  We theoretically control the size of the interpolation area, which converges fast
  enough to zero, giving a necessary condition for exact interpolation and consistency
  to occur in conjunction.'
