title: 'Robust Linear Regression: Gradient-descent, Early-stopping, and Beyond'
abstract: In this work we study the robustness to adversarial attacks, of early-stopping
  strategies on gradient-descent (GD) methods for linear regression. More precisely,
  we show that early-stopped GD is optimally robust (up to an absolute constant) against
  Euclidean-norm adversarial attacks. However, we show that this strategy can be arbitrarily
  sub-optimal in the case of general Mahalanobis attacks. This observation is compatible
  with recent findings in the case of classification Vardi et al. (2022) that show
  that GD provably converges to non-robust models. To alleviate this issue, we propose
  to apply instead a GD scheme on a transformation of the data adapted to the attack.
  This data transformation amounts to apply feature-depending learning rates and we
  show that this modified GD is able to handle any Mahalanobis attack, as well as
  more general attacks under some conditions. Unfortunately, choosing such adapted
  transformations can be hard for general attacks. To the rescue, we design a simple
  and tractable estimator whose adversarial risk is optimal up to within a multiplicative
  constant of 1.1124 in the population regime, and works for any norm.
