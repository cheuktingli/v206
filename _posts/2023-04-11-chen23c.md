title: On-Demand Communication for Asynchronous Multi-Agent Bandits
abstract: This paper studies a cooperative multi-agent multi-armed stochastic bandit
  problem where agents operate asynchronously – agent pull times and rates are unknown,
  irregular, and heterogeneous – and face the same instance of a K-armed bandit problem.
  Agents can share reward information to speed up the learning process at additional
  communication costs. We propose ODC, an on-demand communication protocol that tailors
  the communication of each pair of agents based on their empirical pull times. ODC
  is efficient when the pull times of agents are highly heterogeneous, and its communication
  complexity depends on the empirical pull times of agents. ODC is a generic protocol
  that can be integrated into most cooperative bandit algorithms without degrading
  their performance. We then incorporate ODC into the natural extensions of UCB and
  AAE algorithms and propose two communication-efficient cooperative algorithms. Our
  analysis shows that both algorithms are near-optimal in regret.
