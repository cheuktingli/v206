title: Randomized Primal-Dual Methods with Adaptive Step Sizes
abstract: In this paper we propose a class of randomized primal-dual methods incorporating
  line search to contend with large-scale saddle point (SP) problems defined by a
  convex-concave function $\mathcal L(\mathbf{x},y) = \sum_{i=1}^M f_i(x_i)+\Phi(\mathbf{x},y)-h(y)$.
  We analyze the convergence rate of the proposed method under mere convexity and
  strong convexity assumptions of $\mathcal L$ in $\mathbf{x}$-variable. In particular,
  assuming $\nabla_y\Phi(\cdot,\cdot)$ is Lipschitz and $\nabla_{\mathbf{x}}\Phi(\cdot,y)$
  is coordinate-wise Lipschitz for any fixed $y$, the ergodic sequence generated by
  the algorithm achieves the $\mathcal O(M/k)$ convergence rate in the expected primal-dual
  gap. Furthermore, assuming that $\mathcal L(\cdot,y)$ is strongly convex for any
  $y$, and that $\Phi(\mathbf{x},\cdot)$ is affine for any $\mathbf{x}$, the scheme
  enjoys a faster rate of $\mathcal O(M/k^2)$ in terms of primal solution suboptimality.
  We implemented the proposed algorithmic framework to solve kernel matrix learning
  problem, and tested it against other state-of-the-art first-order methods.
