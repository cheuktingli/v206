title: Stochastic Optimization for Spectral Risk Measures
software: https://github.com/ronakdm/lerm
abstract: Spectral risk objectives – also called L-risks – allow for learning systems
  to interpolate between optimizing average-case performance (as in empirical risk
  minimization) and worst-case performance on a task. We develop LSVRG, a stochastic
  algorithm to optimize these quantities by characterizing their subdifferential and
  addressing challenges such as biasedness of subgradient estimates and non-smoothness
  of the objective. We show theoretically and experimentally that out-of-the-box approaches
  such as stochastic subgradient and dual averaging can be hindered by bias, whereas
  our approach exhibits linear convergence.
