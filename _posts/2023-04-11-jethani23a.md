title: 'Don’t be fooled: label leakage in explanation methods and the importance of
  their quantitative evaluation'
software: https://github.com/explanationleakage/xai
abstract: 'Feature attribution methods identify which features of an input most influence
  a model’s output. Most widely-used feature attribution methods (such as SHAP, LIME,
  and Grad-CAM) are “class-dependent” methods in that they generate a feature attribution
  vector as a function of class. In this work, we demonstrate that class-dependent
  methods can “leak” information about the selected class, making that class appear
  more likely than it is. Thus, an end user runs the risk of drawing false conclusions
  when interpreting an explanation generated by a class-dependent method. In contrast,
  we introduce “distribution-aware” methods, which favor explanations that keep the
  label’s distribution close to its distribution given all features of the input.
  We introduce SHAP-KL and FastSHAP-KL, two baseline distribution-aware methods that
  compute Shapley values. Finally, we perform a comprehensive evaluation of seven
  class-dependent and three distribution-aware methods on three clinical datasets
  of different high-dimensional data types: images, biosignals, and text.'
