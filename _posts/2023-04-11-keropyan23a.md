title: Rank-Based Causal Discovery for Post-Nonlinear Models
abstract: Learning causal relationships from empirical observations is a central task
  in scientific research. A common method is to employ structural causal models that
  postulate noisy functional relations among a set of interacting variables. To ensure
  unique identifiability of causal directions, researchers consider restricted subclasses
  of structural causal models. Post-nonlinear (PNL) causal models constitute one of
  the most flexible options for such restricted subclasses, containing in particular
  the popular additive noise models as a further subclass. However, learning PNL models
  is not well studied beyond the bivariate case. The existing methods learn non-linear
  functional relations by minimizing residual dependencies and subsequently test independence
  from residuals to determine causal orientations. However, these methods can be prone
  to overfitting and, thus, difficult to tune appropriately in practice. As an alternative,
  we propose a new approach for PNL causal discovery that uses rank-based methods
  to estimate the functional parameters. This new approach exploits natural invariances
  of PNL models and disentangles the estimation of the non-linear functions from the
  independence tests used to find causal orientations. We prove consistency of our
  method and validate our results in numerical experiments.
