title: Transport Elliptical Slice Sampling
software: https://github.com/albcab/TESS
abstract: We propose a new framework for efficiently sampling from complex probability
  distributions using a combination of normalizing flows and elliptical slice sampling
  (Murray et al., 2010). The central idea is to learn a diffeomorphism, through normalizing
  flows, that maps the non-Gaussian structure of the target distribution to an approximately
  Gaussian distribution. We then use the elliptical slice sampler, an efficient and
  tuning-free Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm, to sample from the transformed
  distribution. The samples are then pulled back using the inverse normalizing flow,
  yielding samples that approximate the stationary target distribution of interest.
  Our transport elliptical slice sampler (TESS) is optimized for modern computer architectures,
  where its adaptation mechanism utilizes parallel cores to rapidly run multiple Markov
  chains for a few iterations. Numerical demonstrations show that TESS produces Monte
  Carlo samples from the target distribution with lower autocorrelation compared to
  non-transformed samplers, and demonstrates significant improvements in efficiency
  when compared to gradient-based proposals designed for parallel computer architectures,
  given a flexible enough diffeomorphism.
