title: Nearly Optimal Latent State Decoding in Block MDPs
software: https://github.com/nick-jhlee/optimal-block-mdp
abstract: We consider the problem of model estimation in episodic Block MDPs. In these
  MDPs, the decision maker has access to rich observations or contexts generated from
  a small number of latent states. We are interested in estimating the latent state
  decoding function (the mapping from the observations to latent states) based on
  data generated under a fixed behavior policy. We derive an information-theoretical
  lower bound on the error rate for estimating this function and present an algorithm
  approaching this fundamental limit. In turn, our algorithm also provides estimates
  of all the components of the MDP. We apply our results to the problem of learning
  near-optimal policies in the reward-free setting. Based on our efficient model estimation
  algorithm, we show that we can infer a policy converging (as the number of collected
  samples grows large) to the optimal policy at the best possible rate. Our analysis
  provides necessary and sufficient conditions under which exploiting the block structure
  yields improvements in the sample complexity for identifying near-optimal policies.
  When these conditions are met, the sample complexity in the minimax reward-free
  setting is improved by a multiplicative factor $n$, where $n$ is the number of possible
  contexts.
