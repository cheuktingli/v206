title: Learning k-qubit Quantum Operators via Pauli Decomposition
abstract: Motivated by the limited qubit capacity of current quantum systems, we study
  the quantum sample complexity of k-qubit quantum operators, i.e., operations applicable
  on only k out of d qubits. The problem is studied according to the quantum probably
  approximately correct (QPAC) model abiding by quantum mechanical laws such as no-cloning,
  state collapse, and measurement incompatibility. With the delicacy of quantum samples
  and the richness of quantum operations, one expects a significantly larger quantum
  sample complexity. This paper proves the contrary. We show that the quantum sample
  complexity of k-qubit quantum operations is comparable to the classical sample complexity
  of their counterparts (juntas), at least when $\frac{k}{d}\ll 1$. This is surprising,
  especially since sample duplication is prohibited, and measurement incompatibility
  would lead to an exponentially larger sample complexity with standard methods. Our
  approach is based on the Pauli decomposition of quantum operators and a technique
  called Quantum Shadow Sampling (QSS) to reduce the sample complexity exponentially.
  The results are proved by developing (i) a connection between the learning loss
  and the Pauli decomposition; (ii) a scalable QSS circuit for estimating the Pauli
  coefficients; and (iii) a quantum algorithm for learning $k$-qubit operators with
  sample complexity $O(\frac{k4^k}{\epsilon^2}\log d)$.
