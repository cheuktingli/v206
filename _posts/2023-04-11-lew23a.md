title: 'SMCP3: Sequential Monte Carlo with Probabilistic Program Proposals'
software: https://github.com/probcomp/aistats2023-smcp3
abstract: This paper introduces SMCP3, a method for automatically implementing custom
  sequential Monte Carlo samplers for inference in probabilistic programs. Unlike
  particle filters and resample-move SMC (Gilks and Berzuini, 2001), SMCP3 algorithms
  can improve the quality of samples and weights using pairs of Markov proposal kernels
  that are also specified by probabilistic programs. Unlike Del Moral et al. (2006b),
  these proposals can themselves be complex probabilistic computations that generate
  auxiliary variables, apply deterministic transformations, and lack tractable marginal
  densities. This paper also contributes an efficient implementation in Gen that eliminates
  the need to manually derive incremental importance weights. SMCP3 thus simultaneously
  expands the design space that can be explored by SMC practitioners and reduces the
  implementation effort. SMCP3 is illustrated using applications to 3D object tracking,
  state-space modeling, and data clustering, showing that SMCP3 methods can simultaneously
  improve the quality and reduce the cost of marginal likelihood estimation and posterior
  inference.
