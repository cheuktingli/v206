title: 'Distill n’ Explain: explaining graph neural networks using simple surrogates'
software: https://github.com/tamararruda/DnX
abstract: 'Explaining node predictions in graph neural networks (GNNs) often boils
  down to finding graph substructures that preserve predictions. Finding these structures
  usually implies back-propagating through the GNN, bonding the complexity (e.g.,
  number of layers) of the GNN to the cost of explaining it. This naturally begs the
  question: Can we break this bond by explaining a simpler surrogate GNN? To answer
  the question, we propose Distill n’ Explain (DnX). First, DnX learns a surrogate
  GNN via knowledge distillation. Then, DnX extracts node or edge-level explanations
  by solving a simple convex program. We also propose FastDnX, a faster version of
  DnX that leverages the linear decomposition of our surrogate model. Experiments
  show that DnX and FastDnX often outperform state-of-the-art GNN explainers while
  being orders of magnitude faster. Additionally, we support our empirical findings
  with theoretical results linking the quality of the surrogate model (i.e., distillation
  error) to the faithfulness of explanations.'
