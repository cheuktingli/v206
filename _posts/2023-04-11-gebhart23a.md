title: 'Knowledge Sheaves: A Sheaf-Theoretic Framework for Knowledge Graph Embedding'
software: https://github.com/tgebhart/sheaf_kg
abstract: 'Knowledge graph embedding involves learning representations of entities—the
  vertices of the graph—and relations—the edges of the graph—such that the resulting
  representations encode the known factual information represented by the knowledge
  graph and can be used in the inference of new relations. We show that knowledge
  graph embedding is naturally expressed in the topological and categorical language
  of cellular sheaves: a knowledge graph embedding can be described as an approximate
  global section of an appropriate knowledge sheaf over the graph, with consistency
  constraints induced by the knowledge graph’s schema. This approach provides a generalized
  framework for reasoning about knowledge graph embedding models and allows for the
  expression of a wide range of prior constraints on embeddings. Further, the resulting
  embeddings can be easily adapted for reasoning over composite relations without
  special training. We implement these ideas to highlight the benefits of the extensions
  inspired by this new perspective.'
