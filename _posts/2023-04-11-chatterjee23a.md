title: 'Two-Sample Tests for Inhomogeneous Random Graphs in $L_r$ Norm: Optimality
  and Asymptotics'
software: 'https://github.com/sdan2/Lp-graph-testing '
abstract: 'In this paper we study the two-sample problem for inhomogeneous Erdős-Rényi
  (IER), random graph models, in the $L_r$ norm, in the high-dimensional regime where
  the number of samples is smaller or comparable to the size of the graphs. Given
  two symmetric matrices $P, Q \in [0, 1]^{n \times n}$ (with zeros on the diagonals),
  the two-sample problem for IER graphs (with respect to the $L_r$ norm $||\cdot||_r$)
  is to test the hypothesis $H_0: P=Q$ versus $H_1: ||P-Q||_r \geq \varepsilon$, given
  a sample of $m$ graphs from the respective distributions. In this paper, we obtain
  the optimal sample complexity for testing in the $L_r$-norm, for all integers $r
  \geq 1$. We also derive the asymptotic distribution of the optimal tests under $H_0$
  and develop a method for consistently estimating their variances. This allows us
  to efficiently implement the optimal tests with precise asymptotic level and establish
  their asymptotic consistency. We validate our theoretical results by numerical experiments
  for various natural IER models.'
