title: A principled framework for the design and analysis of token algorithms
software: https://github.com/HadrienHx/principled_framework_token_
abstract: We consider a decentralized optimization problem, in which n nodes collaborate
  to optimize a global objective function using local communications only. While many
  decentralized algorithms focus on gossip communications (pairwise averaging), we
  consider a different scheme, in which a “token” that contains the current estimate
  of the model performs a random walk over the network, and updates its model using
  the local model of the node it is at. Indeed, token algorithms generally benefit
  from improved communication efficiency and privacy guarantees. We frame the token
  algorithm as a randomized gossip algorithm on a conceptual graph, which allows us
  to prove a series of convergence results for variance-reduced and accelerated token
  algorithms for the complete graph. We also extend these results to the case of multiple
  tokens by extending the conceptual graph, and to general graphs by tweaking the
  communication procedure. The reduction from token to well-studied gossip algorithms
  leads to tight rates for many token algorithms, and we illustrate their performance
  empirically.
