title: Fair learning with Wasserstein barycenters for non-decomposable performance
  measures
abstract: This work provides several fundamental characterizations of the optimal
  classification function under the demographic parity constraint. In the awareness
  framework, akin to the classical unconstrained classification case, we show that
  maximizing accuracy under this fairness constraint is equivalent to solving a fair
  regression problem followed by thresholding at level $1/2$. We extend this result
  to linear-fractional classification measures (e.g., $F$-score, AM measure, balanced
  accuracy, etc.), highlighting the fundamental role played by regression in this
  framework. Our results leverage recently developed connection between the demographic
  parity constraint and the multi-marginal optimal transport formulation. Informally,
  our result shows that the transition between the unconstrained problem and the fair
  one is achieved by replacing the conditional expectation of the label by the solution
  of the fair regression problem. Finally, leveraging our analysis, we demonstrate
  an equivalence between the awareness and the unawareness setups for two sensitive
  groups.
