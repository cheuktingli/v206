title: Minimax Nonparametric Two-Sample Test under Adversarial Losses
software: https://github.com/rtang1997/Two_sample_test_adversarial
abstract: In this paper, we consider the problem of two-sample hypothesis testing
  that aims at detecting the difference between two probability densities based on
  finite samples. The proposed test statistic is constructed by first truncating a
  sample version of a negative Besov norm and then normalizing it. Here, the negative
  Besov norm is the norm associated with a Besov space with negative exponent, and
  is shown to be closely related to a class of commonly used adversarial losses (or
  integral probability metrics) with smooth discriminators. Theoretically, we characterize
  the optimal detection boundary of two-sample testing in terms of the dimensionalities
  and smoothness levels of the underlying densities and the discriminator class defining
  the adversarial loss. We also show that the proposed approach can simultaneously
  attain the optimal detection boundary under many common adversarial losses, including
  those induced by the $\ell_1$, $\ell_2$ distances and Wasserstein distances. Our
  numerical experiments show that the proposed test procedure tends to exhibit higher
  power and robustness in difference detection than existing state-of-the-art competitors.
