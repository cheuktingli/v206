title: Inducing Neural Collapse in Deep Long-tailed Learning
software: https://github.com/Pepper-lll/NCfeature
abstract: Although deep neural networks achieve tremendous success on various classification
  tasks, the generalization ability drops sheer when training datasets exhibit long-tailed
  distributions. One of the reasons is that the learned representations (i.e. features)
  from the imbalanced datasets are less effective than those from balanced datasets.
  Specifically, the learned representation under class-balanced distribution will
  present the Neural Collapse (NC) phenomena. NC indicates the features from the same
  category are close to each other and from different categories are maximally distant,
  showing an optimal linear separable state of classification. However, the pattern
  differs on imbalanced datasets and is partially responsible for the reduced performance
  of the model. In this work, we propose two explicit feature regularization terms
  to learn high-quality representation for class-imbalanced data. With the proposed
  regularization, NC phenomena will appear under the class-imbalanced distribution,
  and the generalization ability can be significantly improved. Our method is easily
  implemented, highly effective, and can be plugged into most existing methods. The
  extensive experimental results on widely-used benchmarks show the effectiveness
  of our method
