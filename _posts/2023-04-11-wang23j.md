title: Incremental Aggregated Riemannian Gradient Method for Distributed PCA
software: https://github.com/xwangcu/iarg-pca
abstract: We consider the problem of distributed principal component analysis (PCA)
  where the data samples are dispersed across different agents. Despite the rich literature
  on this problem under various specific settings, there is still a lack of efficient
  algorithms that are amenable to decentralized and asynchronous implementations.
  In this paper, we extend the incremental aggregated gradient (IAG) method in convex
  optimization to the nonconvex PCA problems based on an Riemannian gradient-type
  method named IARG-PCA. The IARG-PCA method admits low per-iteration computational
  and communication cost and can be readily implemented in a decentralized and asynchronous
  manner. Moreover, we show that the IARG-PCA method converges linearly to the leading
  eigenvector of the sample covariance of the whole dataset with a constant step size.
  The iteration complexity coincides with the best-known result of the IAG method
  in terms of the linear dependence on the number of agents. Meanwhile, the communication
  complexity is much lower than the state-of-the-art decentralized PCA algorithms
  if the eigengap of the sample covariance is moderate. Numerical experiments on synthetic
  and real datasets show that our IARG-PCA method exhibits substantially lower communication
  cost and comparable computational cost compared with other existing algorithms.
