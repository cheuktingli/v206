title: Score-based Quickest Change Detection for Unnormalized Models
software: https://github.com/suuyawu/Quickest-Change-Detection-for-Unnormalized-Statistical-Models
abstract: Classical change detection algorithms typically require modeling pre-change
  and post-change distributions. The calculations may not be feasible for various
  machine learning models because of the complexity of computing the partition functions
  and normalized distributions. Additionally, these methods may suffer from a lack
  of robustness to model mismatch and noise. In this paper, we develop a new variant
  of the classical Cumulative Sum (CUSUM) change detection, namely Score-based CUSUM
  (SCUSUM), based on Fisher divergence and the Hyvärinen score. Our method allows
  the applications of the quickest change detection for unnormalized distributions.
  We provide a theoretical analysis of the detection delay given the constraints on
  false alarms. We prove the asymptotic optimality of the proposed method in some
  particular cases. We also provide numerical experiments to demonstrate our method’s
  computation, performance, and robustness advantages.
