title: Incorporating functional summary information in Bayesian neural networks using
  a Dirichlet process likelihood approach
software: https://github.com/v-i-s-h/summary-likelihood
abstract: Bayesian neural networks (BNNs) can account for both aleatoric and epistemic
  uncertainty. However, in BNNs the priors are often specified over the weights which
  rarely reflects true prior knowledge in large and complex neural network architectures.
  We present a simple approach to incorporate prior knowledge in BNNs based on external
  summary information about the predicted classification probabilities for a given
  dataset. The available summary information is incorporated as augmented data and
  modeled with a Dirichlet process, and we derive the corresponding Summary Evidence
  Lower BOund. The approach is founded on Bayesian principles, and all hyperparameters
  have a proper probabilistic interpretation. We show how the method can inform the
  model about task difficulty and class imbalance. Extensive experiments show that,
  with negligible computational overhead, our method parallels and in many cases outperforms
  popular alternatives in accuracy, uncertainty calibration, and robustness against
  corruptions with both balanced and imbalanced data.
