title: An Efficient and Continuous Voronoi Density Estimator
software: https://github.com/giovanni-marchetti/rvde
abstract: We introduce a non-parametric density estimator deemed Radial Voronoi Density
  Estimator (RVDE). RVDE is grounded in the geometry of Voronoi tessellations and
  as such benefits from local geometric adaptiveness and broad convergence properties.
  Due to its radial definition RVDE is continuous and computable in linear time with
  respect to the dataset size. This amends for the main shortcomings of previously
  studied VDEs, which are highly discontinuous and computationally expensive. We provide
  a theoretical study of the modes of RVDE as well as an empirical investigation of
  its performance on high-dimensional data. Results show that RVDE outperforms other
  non-parametric density estimators, including recently introduced VDEs.
