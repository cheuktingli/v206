title: Fast Block Coordinate Descent for Non-Convex Group Regularizations
software: https://github.com/yasutoshi/AccelGSCAD
abstract: Non-convex sparse regularizations with group structures are useful tools
  for selecting important feature groups. For optimization with these regularizations,
  block coordinate descent (BCD) is a standard solver that iteratively updates each
  parameter group. However, it suffers from high computation costs for a large number
  of parameter groups. The state-of-the-art method prunes unnecessary updates in BCD
  by utilizing bounds on the norms of the parameter groups. Unfortunately, since it
  computes the bound for each iteration, the computation cost still tends to be high
  when the updates are not sufficiently pruned. This paper proposes a fast BCD for
  non-convex group regularizations. Specifically, it selects a small subset of the
  parameter groups from all the parameter groups on the basis of the bounds and performs
  BCD on the subset. The subset grows step by step in accordance with the bounds during
  optimization. Since it computes the bounds only when selecting and growing the subsets,
  the total cost for computing the bounds is smaller than in the previous method.
  In addition, we theoretically guarantee the convergence of our method. Experiments
  show that our method is up to four times faster than the state-of-the-art method
  and 68 times faster than the original BCD without any loss of accuracy.
