title: Randomized geometric tools for anomaly detection in stock markets
software: https://zenodo.org/record/7198256
abstract: We propose novel randomized geometric tools to detect low-volatility anomalies
  in stock markets; a principal problem in financial economics. Our modeling of the
  (detection) problem results in sampling and estimating the (relative) volume of
  geodesically non-convex and non-connected spherical patches that arise by intersecting
  a non-standard simplex with a sphere. To sample, we introduce two novel Markov Chain
  Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms that exploit the geometry of the problem and employ
  state-of-the-art continuous geometric random walks (such as Billiard walk and Hit-and-Run)
  adapted on spherical patches. To our knowledge, this is the first geometric formulation
  and MCMC-based analysis of the volatility puzzle in stock markets. We have implemented
  our algorithms in C++ (along with an R interface) and we illustrate the power of
  our approach by performing extensive experiments on real data. Our analyses provide
  accurate detection and new insights into the distribution of portfoliosâ€™ performance
  characteristics. Moreover, we use our tools to show that classical methods for low-volatility
  anomaly detection in finance form bad proxies that could lead to misleading or inaccurate
  results.
