title: Privacy-preserving Sparse Generalized Eigenvalue Problem
abstract: In this paper we study the (sparse) Generalized Eigenvalue Problem (GEP),
  which arises in a number of modern statistical learning models, such as principal
  component analysis (PCA), canonical correlation analysis (CCA), Fisherâ€™s discriminant
  analysis (FDA) and sliced inverse regression (SIR). We provide the first study on
  GEP in the differential privacy (DP) model under both deterministic and stochastic
  settings. In the low dimensional case, we provide a $\rho$-Concentrated DP (CDP)
  method namely DP-Rayleigh Flow and show if the initial vector is close enough to
  the optimal vector, its output has an $\ell_2$-norm estimation error of $\tilde{O}(\frac{d}{n}+\frac{d}{n^2\rho})$
  (under some mild assumptions), where $d$ is the dimension and $n$ is the sample
  size. Next, we discuss how to find such a initial parameter privately. In the high
  dimensional sparse case where $d\gg n$, we propose the DP-Truncated Rayleigh Flow
  method whose output could achieve an error of $\tilde{O}(\frac{s\log d}{n}+\frac{s\log
  d}{n^2\rho})$ for various statistical models, where $s$ is the sparsity of the underlying
  parameter.Moreover, we show that these errors in the stochastic setting are optimal
  up to a factor of $\mathrm{Poly}(\log n)$ by providing the lower bounds of PCA and
  SIR under statistical setting and in the CDP model. Finally, to give a separation
  between $\epsilon$-DP and $\rho$-CDP for GEP, we also provide the lower bound $\Omega(\frac{d}{n}+\frac{d^2}{n^2\epsilon^2})$
  and $\Omega(\frac{s\log d}{n}+\frac{s^2\log^2 d}{n^2\epsilon^2})$ of private minimax
  risk for PCA, under the statistical setting and $\epsilon$-DP model, in low and
  high dimensional sparse case respectively.
