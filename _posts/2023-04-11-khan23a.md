title: Barlow Graph Auto-Encoder for Unsupervised Network Embedding
software: https://github.com/RayyanRiaz/bvgae
abstract: Network embedding has emerged as a promising research field for network
  analysis. Recently, an approach, named Barlow Twins, has been proposed for self-supervised
  learning in computer vision by applying the redundancy-reduction principle to the
  embedding vectors corresponding to two distorted versions of the image samples.
  Motivated by this, we propose Barlow Graph Auto-Encoder, a simple yet effective
  architecture for learning network embedding. It aims to maximize the similarity
  between the embedding vectors of immediate and larger neighborhoods of a node while
  minimizing the redundancy between the components of these projections. In addition,
  we also present the variational counterpart named Barlow Variational Graph Auto-Encoder.
  We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in learning multiple graph-related
  tasks, i.e., link prediction, clustering, and downstream node classification, by
  providing extensive comparisons with several well-known techniques on eight benchmark
  datasets.
