title: Improving Adversarial Robustness via Joint Classification and Multiple Explicit
  Detection Classes
software: https://github.com/sinaBaharlouei/MultipleAbstainDetection
abstract: This work concerns the development of deep networks that are certifiably
  robust to adversarial attacks. Joint robust classification-detection was recently
  introduced as a certified defense mechanism, where adversarial examples are either
  correctly classified or assigned to the “abstain” class. In this work, we show that
  such a provable framework can benefit by extension to networks with multiple explicit
  abstain classes, where the adversarial examples are adaptively assigned to those.
  We show that naïvely adding multiple abstain classes can lead to “model degeneracy”,
  then we propose a regularization approach and a training method to counter this
  degeneracy by promoting full use of the multiple abstain classes. Our experiments
  demonstrate that the proposed approach consistently achieves favorable standard
  vs. robust verified accuracy tradeoffs, outperforming state-of-the-art algorithms
  for various choices of number of abstain classes.
