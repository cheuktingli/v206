title: Mixed Linear Regression via Approximate Message Passing
abstract: In mixed linear regression, each observation comes from one of L regression
  vectors (signals), but we do not know which one. The goal is to estimate the signals
  from the unlabeled observations. We propose a novel approximate message passing
  (AMP) algorithm for estimation and rigorously characterize its performance in the
  high-dimensional limit. This characterization is in terms of a state evolution recursion,
  which allows us to precisely compute performance measures such as the asymptotic
  mean-squared error. This can be used to tailor the AMP algorithm to take advantage
  of any known structural information about the signals. Using state evolution, we
  derive an optimal choice of AMP ‘denoising’ functions that minimizes the estimation
  error in each iteration. Numerical simulations are provided to validate the theoretical
  results, and show that AMP significantly outperforms other estimators including
  spectral methods, expectation maximization, and alternating minimization. Though
  our numerical results focus on mixed linear regression, the proposed AMP algorithm
  can be applied to a broader class of models including mixtures of generalized linear
  models and max-affine regression.
