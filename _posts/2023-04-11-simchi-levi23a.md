title: 'Multi-armed Bandit Experimental Design: Online Decision-making and Adaptive
  Inference'
abstract: Multi-armed bandit has been well-known for its efficiency in online decision-making
  in terms of minimizing the loss of the participantsâ€™ welfare during experiments
  (i.e., the regret). In clinical trials and many other scenarios, the statistical
  power of inferring the treatment effects (i.e., the gaps between the mean outcomes
  of different arms) is also crucial. Nevertheless, minimizing the regret entails
  harming the statistical power of estimating the treatment effect, since the observations
  from some arms can be limited. In this paper, we investigate the trade-off between
  efficiency and statistical power by casting the multi-armed bandit experimental
  design into a minimax multi-objective optimization problem. We introduce the concept
  of Pareto optimality to mathematically characterize the situation in which neither
  the statistical power nor the efficiency can be improved without degrading the other.
  We derive a useful sufficient and necessary condition for the Pareto optimal solutions.
  Additionally, we design an effective Pareto optimal multi-armed bandit experiment
  that can be tailored to different levels of the trade-off between the two objectives.
