title: Nothing but Regrets — Privacy-Preserving Federated Causal Discovery
software: https://eda.rg.cispa.io/prj/peri/
abstract: In critical applications, causal models are the prime choice for their trustworthiness
  and explainability. If data is inherently distributed and privacy-sensitive, federated
  learning allows for collaboratively training a joint model. Existing approaches
  for federated causal discovery share locally discovered causal model in every iteration,
  therewith not only revealing local structure but also leading to very high communication
  costs. Instead, we propose an approach for privacy-preserving federated causal discovery
  by distributed min-max regret optimization. We prove that max-regret is a consistent
  scoring criterion that can be used within the well-known Greedy Equivalence Search
  to discover causal networks in a federated setting and is provably privacy-preserving
  at the same time. Through extensive experiments, we show that our approach reliably
  discovers causal networks without ever looking at local data and beats the state
  of the art both in terms of the quality of discovered causal networks as well as
  communication efficiency.
