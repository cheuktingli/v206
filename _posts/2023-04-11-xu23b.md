title: A Tale of Two Efficient Value Iteration Algorithms for Solving Linear MDPs
  with Large Action Space
abstract: Markov Decision Process (MDP) with large action space naturally occurs in
  many applications such as language processing, information retrieval, and recommendation
  system. There have been various approaches to solve these MDPs through value iteration
  (VI). Unfortunately, all VI algorithms require expensive linear scans over the entire
  action space for value function estimation during each iteration. To this end, we
  present two provable Least-Squares Value Iteration (LSVI) algorithms with runtime
  complexity sublinear in the number of actions for linear MDPs. We formulate the
  value function estimation procedure in VI as an approximate maximum inner product
  search problem and propose a Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH) type data structure
  to solve this problem with sublinear time complexity. Our major contribution is
  combining the guarantees of approximate maximum inner product search with the regret
  analysis of reinforcement learning. We prove that, with the appropriate choice of
  approximation factor, there exists a sweet spot. Our proposed Sublinear LSVI algorithms
  maintain the same regret as the original LSVI algorithms while reducing the runtime
  complexity to sublinear in the number of actions. To the best of our knowledge,
  this is the first work that combines LSH with reinforcement learning that results
  in provable improvements. We hope that our novel way of combining data structures
  and the iterative algorithm will open the door for further study into the cost reduction
  in reinforcement learning.
