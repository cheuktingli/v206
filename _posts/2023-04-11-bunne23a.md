title: The Schrödinger Bridge between Gaussian Measures has a Closed Form
software: https://github.com/bunnech/gsbflow
abstract: The static optimal transport $(\mathrm{OT})$ problem between Gaussians seeks
  to recover an optimal map, or more generally a coupling, to morph a Gaussian into
  another. It has been well studied and applied to a wide variety of tasks. Here we
  focus on the dynamic formulation of OT, also known as the Schrödinger bridge (SB)
  problem, which has recently seen a surge of interest in machine learning due to
  its connections with diffusion-based generative models. In contrast to the static
  setting, much less is known about the dynamic setting, even for Gaussian distributions.
  In this paper, we provide closed-form expressions for SBs between Gaussian measures.
  In contrast to the static Gaussian OT problem, which can be simply reduced to studying
  convex programs, our framework for solving SBs requires significantly more involved
  tools such as Riemannian geometry and generator theory. Notably, we establish that
  the solutions of SBs between Gaussian measures are themselves Gaussian processes
  with explicit mean and covariance kernels, and thus are readily amenable for many
  downstream applications such as generative modeling or interpolation. To demonstrate
  the utility, we devise a new method for modeling the evolution of single-cell genomics
  data and report significantly improved numerical stability compared to existing
  SB-based approaches.
