title: 'Singular Value Representation: A New Graph Perspective On Neural Networks'
software: https://github.com/danmlr/svr
abstract: 'We introduce the Singular Value Representation (SVR), a new method to represent
  the internal state of neural networks using SVD factorization of the weights. This
  construction yields a new weighted graph connecting what we call spectral neurons,
  that correspond to specific activation patterns of classical neurons. We derive
  a precise statistical framework to discriminate meaningful connections between spectral
  neurons for fully connected and convolutional layers. To demonstrate the usefulness
  of our approach for machine learning research, we highlight two discoveries we made
  using the SVR. First, we highlight the emergence of a dominant connection in VGG
  networks that spans multiple deep layers. Second, we witness, without relying on
  any input data, that batch normalization can induce significant connections between
  near-kernels of deep layers, leading to a remarkable spontaneous sparsification
  phenomenon. code: a python implementation of the svr can be found at https://github.com/danmlr/svr.'
