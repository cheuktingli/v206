title: Sample Complexity of Kernel-Based Q-Learning
abstract: Modern reinforcement learning (RL) often faces an enormous state-action
  space. Existing analytical results are typically for settings with a small number
  of state-actions, or simple models such as linearly modeled Q functions. To derive
  statistically efficient RL policies handling large state-action spaces, with more
  general Q functions, some recent works have considered nonlinear function approximation
  using kernel ridge regression. In this work, we derive sample complexities for kernel
  based Q-learning when a generative model exists. We propose a non-parametric Q-learning
  algorithm which finds an $\varepsilon$-optimal policy in an arbitrarily large scale
  discounted MDP. The sample complexity of the proposed algorithm is order optimal
  with respect to $\varepsilon$ and the complexity of the kernel (in terms of its
  information gain). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first result showing
  a finite sample complexity under such a general model.
