title: Efficient fair PCA for fair representation learning
software: https://github.com/amazon-science/fair-pca
abstract: We revisit the problem of fair principal component analysis (PCA), where
  the goal is to learn the best low-rank linear approximation of the data that obfuscates
  demographic information. We propose a conceptually simple approach that allows for
  an analytic solution similar to standard PCA and can be kernelized. Our methods
  have the same complexity as standard PCA, or kernel PCA, and run much faster than
  existing methods for fair PCA based on semidefinite programming or manifold optimization,
  while achieving similar results.
