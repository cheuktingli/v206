title: Learning Constrained Structured Spaces with Application to Multi-Graph Matching
software: https://github.com/HeddaCohenIndelman/Learning-Constrained-Structured-Spaces-with-Application-to-Multi-Graph-Matching
abstract: Multi-graph matching is a prominent structured prediction task, in which
  the predicted label is constrained to the space of cycle-consistent matchings. While
  direct loss minimization is an effective method for learning predictors over structured
  label spaces, it cannot be applied efficiently to the problem at hand, since executing
  a specialized solver across sets of matching predictions is computationally prohibitive.
  Moreover, there’s no supervision on the ground-truth matchings over cycle-consistent
  prediction sets. Our key insight is to strictly enforce the matching constraints
  in pairwise matching predictions and softly enforce the cycle-consistency constraints
  by casting them as weighted loss terms, such that the severity of inconsistency
  with global predictions is tuned by a penalty parameter. Inspired by the classic
  penalty method, we prove that our method theoretically recovers the optimal multi-graph
  matching constrained solution. Our method’s advantages are brought to light in experimental
  results on the popular keypoint matching task on the Pascal VOC and the Willow ObjectClass
  datasets.
