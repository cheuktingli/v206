title: 'NTS-NOTEARS: Learning Nonparametric DBNs With Prior Knowledge'
software: https://github.com/xiangyu-sun-789/NTS-NOTEARS
abstract: We describe NTS-NOTEARS, a score-based structure learning method for time-series
  data to learn dynamic Bayesian networks (DBNs) that captures nonlinear, lagged (inter-slice)
  and instantaneous (intra-slice) relations among variables. NTS-NOTEARS utilizes
  1D convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to model the dependence of child variables
  on their parents; 1D CNN is a neural function approximation model well-suited for
  sequential data. DBN-CNN structure learning is formulated as a continuous optimization
  problem with an acyclicity constraint, following the NOTEARS DAG learning approach
  (Zheng et al., 2018, 2020). We show how prior knowledge of dependencies (e.g., forbidden
  and required edges) can be included as additional optimization constraints. Empirical
  evaluation on simulated and benchmark data shows that NTS-NOTEARS achieves state-of-the-art
  DAG structure quality compared to both parametric and nonparametric baseline methods,
  with improvement in the range of 10-20$%$ on the F1-score. We also evaluate NTS-NOTEARS
  on complex real-world data acquired from professional ice hockey games that contain
  a mixture of continuous and discrete variables. The code is available online.
