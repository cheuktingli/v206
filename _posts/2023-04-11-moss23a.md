title: Inducing Point Allocation for Sparse Gaussian Processes in High-Throughput
  Bayesian Optimisation
software: https://github.com/secondmind-labs/trieste/blob/develop/trieste/models/gpflow/inducing_point_selectors.py
abstract: Sparse Gaussian processes are a key component of high-throughput Bayesian
  optimisation (BO) loops; however, we show that existing methods for allocating their
  inducing points severely hamper optimisation performance. By exploiting the quality-diversity
  decomposition of determinantal point processes, we propose the first inducing point
  allocation strategy designed specifically for use in BO. Unlike existing methods
  which seek only to reduce global uncertainty in the objective function, our approach
  provides the local high-fidelity modelling of promising regions required for precise
  optimisation. More generally, we demonstrate that our proposed framework provides
  a flexible way to allocate modelling capacity in sparse models and so is suitable
  for a broad range of downstream sequential decision making tasks.
