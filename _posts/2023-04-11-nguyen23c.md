title: Asymptotic Bayes risk of semi-supervised multitask learning on Gaussian mixture
software: https://github.com/Minh-Toan/Bayes-risk
abstract: The article considers semi-supervised multitask learning on a Gaussian mixture
  model (GMM). Using methods from statistical physics, we compute the asymptotic Bayes
  risk of each task in the regime of large datasets in high dimension, from which
  we analyze the role of task similarity in learning and evaluate the performance
  gain when tasks are learned together rather than separately. In the supervised case,
  we derive a simple algorithm that attains the Bayes optimal performance.
