title: Multi-task Representation Learning with Stochastic Linear Bandits
abstract: We study the problem of transfer-learning in the setting of stochastic linear
  contextual bandit tasks. We consider that a low dimensional linear representation
  is shared across the tasks, and study the benefit of learning the tasks jointly.
  Following recent results to design Lasso stochastic bandit policies, we propose
  an efficient greedy policy based on trace norm regularization. It implicitly learns
  a low dimensional representation by encouraging the matrix formed by the task regression
  vectors to be of low rank. Unlike previous work in the literature, our policy does
  not need to know the rank of the underlying matrix, nor {does} it requires the covariance
  of the arms distribution to be invertible. We derive an upper bound on the multi-task
  regret of our policy, which is, up to logarithmic factors, of order $T\sqrt{rN}+\sqrt{rNTd}$,
  where $T$ is the number of tasks, $r$ the rank, $d$ the number of variables and
  $N$ the number of rounds per task. We show the benefit of our strategy over an independent
  task learning baseline, which has a worse regret of order $T\sqrt{dN}$. We also
  argue that our policy {is minimax optimal} and, when $T\geq d$, has a multi-task
  regret which is comparable to the regret of an oracle policy which knows the true
  underlying representation.
