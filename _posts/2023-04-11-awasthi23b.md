title: Theory and Algorithm for Batch Distribution Drift Problems
abstract: We study a problem of batch distribution drift motivated by several applications,
  which consists of determining an accurate predictor for a target time segment, for
  which a moderate amount of labeled samples are at oneâ€™s disposal, while leveraging
  past segments for which substantially more labeled samples are available. We give
  new algorithms for this problem guided by a new theoretical analysis and generalization
  bounds derived for this scenario. We further extend our results to the case where
  few or no labeled data is available for the period of interest. Finally, we report
  the results of extensive experiments demonstrating the benefits of our drifting
  algorithm, including comparisons with natural baselines. A by-product of our study
  is a principled solution to the problem of multiple-source adaptation with labeled
  source data and a moderate amount of target labeled data, which we briefly discuss
  and compare with.
