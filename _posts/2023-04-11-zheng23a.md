title: Knowledge Acquisition for Human-In-The-Loop Image Captioning
software: https://github.com/ritmininglab/KA-HITP
abstract: Image captioning offers a computational process to understand the semantics
  of images and convey them using descriptive language. However, automated captioning
  models may not always generate satisfactory captions due to the complex nature of
  the images and the quality/size of the training data. We propose an interactive
  captioning framework to improve machine-generated captions by keeping humans in
  the loop and performing an online-offline knowledge acquisition (KA) process. In
  particular, online KA accepts a list of keywords specified by human users and fuses
  them with the image features to generate a readable sentence that captures the semantics
  of the image. It leverages a multimodal conditioned caption completion mechanism
  to ensure the appearance of all user-input keywords in the generated caption. Offline
  KA further learns from the user inputs to update the model and benefits caption
  generation for unseen images in the future. It is built upon a Bayesian transformer
  architecture that dynamically allocates neural resources and supports uncertainty-aware
  model updates to mitigate overfitting. Our theoretical analysis also proves that
  Offline KA automatically selects the best model capacity to accommodate the newly
  acquired knowledge. Experiments on real-world data demonstrate the effectiveness
  of the proposed framework.
