title: A Multi-Task Gaussian Process Model for Inferring Time-Varying Treatment Effects
  in Panel Data
software: https://github.com/yahoochen97/aistats2023_606
abstract: We introduce a Bayesian multi-task Gaussian process model for estimating
  treatment effects from panel data, where an intervention outside the observerâ€™s
  control influences a subset of the observed units. Our model encodes structured
  temporal dynamics both within and across the treatment and control groups and incorporates
  a flexible prior for the evolution of treatment effects over time. These innovations
  aid in inferring posteriors for dynamic treatment effects that encode our uncertainty
  about the likely trajectories of units in the absence of treatment. We also discuss
  the asymptotic properties of the joint posterior over counterfactual outcomes and
  treatment effects, which exhibits intuitive behavior in the large-sample limit.
  In experiments on both synthetic and real data, our approach performs no worse than
  existing methods and significantly better when standard assumptions are violated.
