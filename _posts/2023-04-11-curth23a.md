title: Understanding the Impact of Competing Events on Heterogeneous Treatment Effect
  Estimation from Time-to-Event Data
software: https://github.com/AliciaCurth/CompCATE
abstract: We study the problem of inferring heterogeneous treatment effects (HTEs)
  from time-to-event data in the presence of competing events. Albeit its great practical
  relevance, this problem has received little attention compared to its counterparts
  studying HTE estimation without time-to-event data or competing events. We take
  an outcome modeling approach to estimating HTEs, and consider how and when existing
  prediction models for time-to-event data can be used as plug-in estimators for potential
  outcomes. We then investigate whether competing events present new challenges for
  HTE estimation – in addition to the standard confounding problem –, and find that,
  because there are multiple definitions of causal effects in this setting – namely
  total, direct and separable effects –, competing events can act as an additional
  source of covariate shift depending on the desired treatment effect interpretation
  and associated estimand. We theoretically analyze and empirically illustrate when
  and how these challenges play a role when using generic machine learning prediction
  models for the estimation of HTEs.
